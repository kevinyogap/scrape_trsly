<h1>How Many Meters Can a Cat Safely Fall from a Height?</h1>

<p>Scientists have conducted research to determine the safe height from which a cat can fall.</p>

<h2>How High is it Safe for a Cat to Fall from?</h2>

<h2>Cats are adorable pets with unique and charming behaviors that make them famous.</h2>

<p>However, there are also cat behaviors that can make their owners feel worried, such as their habit of climbing high places.</p>

<p>Researchers also cannot determine the exact upper limit of it.</p>

<p>According to BBC Science Focus, Catster, The Atlantic, and WIRED, there was once a cat that fell from the 32nd floor of a building and survived. But still, the cat needs medical treatment.</p>

<span></span>

<p>Assuming that each floor has a height of 3 meters, the cat fell from a height of 96 meters.</p>

<h2>In a study conducted in 1987, researchers examined 132 cats that had fallen from an average height of 5.5 floors and survived, being taken to a veterinarian. </h2>

<p>The results showed that more than 90% of the treated cats survived.</p>

<h2>There is an interesting finding from the research.</h2>

<span></span>

<p>Cats that fall - and survive - from seven floors tend to have more severe injuries compared to cats that fall from floors higher than the seventh floor.</p>

<span></span>

<p>Researchers believe that this happens because a cat reaches its terminal velocity after falling through seven floors or a height of 21 meters.</p>

Terminal velocity is the speed at which an object reaches when the drag force and buoyant force are equal to the force of gravity.

<br><br>

As a result, the object, in this case a cat, will move at a constant speed because its acceleration becomes zero.

<br><br>

The terminal velocity of a cat weighing around 4 kg is approximately 96.5 km/h, half that of an average human with body weight.

<span></span>

<p>When reaching terminal velocity, cats will become relaxed, resulting in better distribution of impact.</p>

<p>This is reflected in the study, where cats that fall from a very high height are more likely to sustain chest injuries, while those that fall from an average height of four floors are more likely to suffer broken leg bones.</p>

Although many things have been revealed about the safety of cats falling from high places, the research only examined cats that fell and survived. The study did not count/include the number of cats that died immediately after falling.

<br><br>

In 2004, there was a similar study that also discussed cats that died after falling from high places. Out of 119 cats that had fallen from high places, 96.5% of the cats survived after falling from an average height of four floors or 17 meters.
