We speak, write, listen, and read, but many people do not stop to think about how important language is. It helps us work, study, and connect with others. Still, not everyone understands the full meaning and functions of language.</p>\n\n<p>The functions of language are more than just talking and listening. Language allows us to share ideas, express feelings, ask for things, and build relationships. However, the functions of language are often much deeper than they seem at first glance.</p>\n\n<p>In this article, we will explore what language is according to various experts and functions of language according to Geoffrey Leech and Roman Jakobson. We gathered the information from various sources, Monday (28/4/2025).</p>\n\n<h2>What is Language?</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/DIHcdAx4WjcjP0oI50idbe23Fu58PRecMml1YzB3.jpg\" alt=\"The Functions of Language According to Experts\"/>\n\n<figcaption>What is language? (Image by rawpixel.com on Freepik)</figcaption>\n\n<p>Before we discuss the functions of language, let's understand what language is. Many experts have given different definitions of language over time.</p>\n\n<p>According to Edward Sapir, language is \"a purely human and non-instinctive method of communicating ideas, emotions, and desires by means of a system of voluntarily produced symbols.\" This means language is something only humans use, and we create it ourselves to share our thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>Ferdinand de Saussure defined language as \"a system of signs that express ideas.\" He explained that language works through signs that have two parts: the sound or written shape (signifier) and the meaning (signified).</p>\n\n<p>Noam Chomsky, a famous language expert, says language is \"the inherent capability of native speakers to understand and form grammatical sentences.\" He believes humans are born with the ability to learn language.</p>\n\n<p>John Lyons describes languages as \"the principal communication systems used by particular groups of human beings within the specific society of which they are members.\" This definition shows how language connects people in communities.</p>\n\n<p>Henry Sweet, an English language scholar, stated that \"Language is the expression of ideas by means of speech-sounds combined into words. Words are combined into sentences, this combination answering to that of ideas into thoughts.\" This definition focuses on how sounds form words and how words form sentences.</p>\n\n<p>Bernard Bloch and George L. Trager defined language as \"a system of arbitrary vocal symbols by means of which a social group cooperates.\" This highlights that language uses sounds that have no natural connection to their meanings, and that language helps people work together.</p>\n\n<p>Aristotle, an ancient Greek philosopher, saw language as \"the representation of the experience of the mind.\" He believed that when we speak, we are showing what is happening in our minds.</p>\n\n<p>Bloomfield defined language as \"the totality of the utterances that can be made in a speech community.\" This means language includes all the possible things that can be said by a group of people who speak to each other.</p>\n\n<p>Derbyshire described language as \"undoubtedly a kind of communication among human beings\" that is \"primarily vocal sounds, articulatory, systematic, symbolic, and arbitrary.\" This definition points out that language follows patterns and uses symbols that we agree on.</p>\n\n<h2>5 Functions of Language According to Geoffrey Leech</h2>\n\n<p>Geoffrey Leech, who lived from 1936 to 2014, identified five main functions of language that help us understand how we use it in daily life:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. The Informational Function: </strong>This is used to provide facts and knowledge. When we describe things, explain processes, or give news, we use the informational function. Examples include textbooks, encyclopedias, news reports, and facts like \"Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. The Expressive Function:</strong> This function helps us share our feelings, attitudes, and opinions. When you say \"I love this song\" or \"That movie was boring,\" you are using the expressive function. It doesn't give factual information but shows your emotions or thoughts about something.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. The Directive Function: </strong>This function aims to cause some action or reaction from the listener. Commands like \"Close the door,\" requests such as \"Could you help me?\", and advice like \"You should study more\" all use the directive function. The success of this function depends on whether the listener follows the direction.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. The Aesthetic Function:</strong> This function focuses on the beauty of language itself. Poetry, literature, songs, and creative writing use language for its beauty and artistic value. The aesthetic function treats words as art and focuses on how language sounds and feels rather than just what it means.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. The Phatic Function: </strong>This function helps establish and maintain social relationships. Small talk like \"How are you?\" or \"Nice weather today\" may not share important information but keeps social connections open. Greetings, goodbyes, and casual conversation all serve the phatic function.</p>\n\n<h2>6 Functions of Language According to Roman Jakobson</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/4AZbxV524AHfTIO2vot2E7XYOkaX4ZS2lBrASJeC.jpg\" alt=\"The Functions of Language According to Experts\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Six functions of language according to Roman Jakobson. (Photo by Christina @ wocintechchat.com on )</figcaption>\n\n<p>Roman Jakobson, who lived from 1896 to 1982, developed another model with six functions of language:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. The Referential Function: </strong>This function describes situations, objects, or mental states. It focuses on providing context. Weather reports, descriptions, and statements of fact use this function. For example, \"It is raining in New York today.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. The Poetic Function:</strong> This focuses on the message itself and how it is presented. It is used in poetry, slogans, and wordplay. The famous slogan \"Just Do It\" uses the poetic function through its rhythm and simplicity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. The Emotive Function: </strong>Similar to Leech's expressive function, this reveals the speaker's feelings. Interjections like \"Wow!\" or \"Ouch!\" and statements of emotion use this function.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. The Conative Function: </strong>This function aims to make the receiver do something. It uses commands and requests like \"Please sit down\" or \"Vote for me!\" The focus is on creating a response from the listener.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. The Phatic Function: </strong>Like Leech's phatic function, this is used to establish contact and maintain relationships. Greetings, farewells, and phrases like \"Can you hear me?\" serve this purpose.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. The Metalingual Function: </strong>This unique function uses language to talk about language itself. When you ask \"What does this word mean?\" or discuss grammar rules, you are using the metalingual function.</p>\n\n<h2>Other Functions of Language</h2>\n\n<p>Beyond Leech and Jakobson, there are other functions of language that help us understand its importance:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. The Social Function: </strong>This helps people form and maintain groups and communities. Language creates bonds between people who speak the same language or dialect and helps establish identity within social groups. When people use similar words or accents, they often feel connected to each other.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. The Cognitive Function: </strong>This is how language shapes our thinking and helps us organize our thoughts. Some experts believe the language we speak influences how we see and understand the world around us. Different languages may lead people to notice different aspects of their environment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. The Cultural Function: </strong>Language preserves traditions, stories, and values across generations. Through language, we pass down knowledge and cultural practices that maintain our connection to the past. Stories, proverbs, and songs keep culture alive through language.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. The Political Function: </strong>This concerns how language is used to gain or maintain power. Politicians carefully choose their words to persuade people, and groups in society may use language to include or exclude others. Language can be a tool for unity or division.</p>"

(2001)</h2>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ddl0yH-LEi4?si=dHQ128OHSYy-REbv\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Originally featured on the Angus movie soundtrack and later included in International Superhits!, “J.A.R.” is a tribute to bassist Mike Dirnt’s childhood friend who passed away in a car accident.</p>\n\n<p>It's a powerful punk anthem that blends emotional lyrics with Green Day’s signature energetic sound.</p>\n\n<p>Despite charting briefly, the song has often been overshadowed by bigger hits like “Basket Case” or “When I Come Around.”</p>\n\n<p>Yet, its introspective theme, strong hooks, and tight instrumentation make it one of their most heartfelt and overlooked tracks.</p>\n\n<h2>2. “Stuart and the Ave.” – Insomniac (1995)</h2>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LxmAGklaKMk?si=jViYTkIolib7w5qc\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Buried in the fast and furious Insomniac album, “Stuart and the Ave.” captures the frustration and confusion of personal disillusionment and relationships.</p>\n\n<p>The raw energy, angsty vocals, and a more abrasive sound highlight a darker period for the band post-Dookie.</p>\n\n<p>With its gritty guitar riffs and emotionally charged delivery, the song is a perfect representation of Green Day’s ability to turn angst into art.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, it often goes unnoticed among fans and critics alike.</p>\n\n<h2>3. “Whatsername” – American Idiot (2004)</h2>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZyynCiqAGFE?si=-XLZBiBBGjYMkTx2\"></iframe>\n\n<p>As the final track of the iconic American Idiot rock opera, “Whatsername” delivers a bittersweet reflection on love, memory, and moving on.</p>\n\n<p>Its quiet buildup to an emotional crescendo makes it a beautifully crafted closer to the story of the album’s protagonist, Jesus of Suburbia.</p>\n\n<p>Despite its narrative importance and haunting melody, it’s often overlooked in favor of more explosive singles like “Holiday” or “Boulevard of Broken Dreams.”</p>\n\n<p>“Whatsername” subtly lingers in listeners’ minds long after the album ends.</p>\n\n<h2>4. “Macy’s Day Parade” – Warning (2000)</h2>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4EL4njT8g98?si=OgohOd40Lm5TnKli\"></iframe>\n\n<p>A mellow acoustic ballad in contrast to Green Day’s typical punk fury, “Macy’s Day Parade” is a somber commentary on materialism and the search for meaning.</p>\n\n<p>Closing out the Warning album, it highlights a more mature and contemplative side of the band.</p>\n\n<p>Billie Joe Armstrong’s reflective lyrics and subdued vocals lend emotional weight, making it a quiet gem.</p>\n\n<p>It didn’t receive the attention it deserved due to the album’s lower commercial performance, but the song showcases Green Day’s lyrical growth and sonic experimentation.</p>\n\n<h2>5. “Peacemaker” – 21st Century Breakdown (2009)</h2>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/R6XDAC55iss?si=5SDUNddDy3foFYUL\"></iframe>\n\n<p>“Peacemaker” is one of the most experimental and theatrical tracks on 21st Century Breakdown, fusing Latin rhythms with punk-rock flair.</p>\n\n<p>Its sharp lyrics and playful yet biting tone critique violence and hypocrisy, wrapped in a melody that sounds almost like a rebellious cabaret.</p>\n\n<p>The song’s creativity and uniqueness within Green Day’s catalog are often overlooked due to the overshadowing success of tracks like “21 Guns.”</p>\n\n<p>Yet, “Peacemaker” stands out as a testament to Green Day’s willingness to evolve and take risks.</p>"

Definitions, Types, and Their Impacts to the Economy\"/>\n\n<h1>What Are Tariffs? Definitions, Types, and Their Impacts to the Economy</h1>\n\n<p>After President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China on February 1, 2025, many people may wonder: what are tariffs? These tariffs include a 25% tax on goods from Mexico and Canada and a 10% tax on Chinese imports. The goal of these tariffs is to protect American jobs and industries. However, many people are concerned about how these tariffs will affect prices for everyday products.</p>\n\n<p>So, what are tariffs? Tariffs are taxes that countries impose on imported goods. They make foreign products more expensive, encouraging people to buy local products instead. Understanding what tariffs are is important because they can affect the economy, jobs, and the prices of many items we buy daily.</p>\n\n<p>In this article, we will explain what tariffs are, how they work, and their positive and negative effects on the economy and consumers. We gathered the information from various sources, Sunday (1/2/2025). This will help you understand why tariffs matter in today’s world.</p>\n\n<h2>What Are Tariffs?</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/3EmBmuI5ZDhplxjznp6w90G1WEtQzRztUkui13F3.jpg\" alt=\"What Are Tariffs? Definitions, Types, and Their Impacts to the Economy\"/>\n\n<figcaption>What are tariffs and how do they work? (Image by Freepik)</figcaption>\n\n<p>A tariff is a tax that a government places on goods imported from other countries. When a country imposes a tariff, it makes foreign products more expensive. This encourages consumers to buy products made in their own country instead of imported ones.</p>\n\n<p>There are four main types of tariffs:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Ad Valorem Tariffs: </strong>These are based on a percentage of the value of the imported goods. For example, if you import a product worth $100 and there is a 10% tariff, you will pay $10 in tax.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Specific Tariffs:</strong> These are fixed amounts charged per unit of goods. For example, if there is a $1 tariff on each imported avocado, you will pay $1 for every avocado you bring into the country.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Tariff-Rate Quotas: </strong>These allow a certain amount of goods to be imported at a lower tariff rate. Once that amount is exceeded, a higher tariff applies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Compound Tariffs:</strong> These combine both ad valorem and specific tariffs. For example, an imported product may have a fixed charge plus a percentage of its value as the tariff.</p>\n\n<p>Tariffs can vary depending on the type of product and the country it comes from. They are collected by customs officials when goods enter the country.</p>\n\n<h2>How Do Tariffs Work?</h2>\n\n<p>Tariffs work by increasing the cost of imported goods. When tariffs are imposed, companies that import these goods must pay the tax to the government. This cost is often passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if a company imports shoes from another country and there is a 20% tariff on those shoes, the company pays more for them. To cover this cost, the company may raise the price of the shoes in stores. As a result, consumers end up paying more for these imported shoes.</p>\n\n<p>Tariffs can also affect domestic industries. When foreign products become more expensive due to tariffs, consumers may choose to buy locally made products instead. This can help local businesses grow and create jobs.</p>\n\n<p>However, tariffs do not always lead to positive outcomes for everyone. While some local industries may benefit from reduced competition from foreign products, other industries that rely on imported materials may suffer from increased costs.</p>\n\n<h2>Positive Effects of Tariffs</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/hqVywmar1bRSxzGiZHNYT9JVvKoWZKo7VfaOIRIY.jpg\" alt=\"What Are Tariffs? Definitions, Types, and Their Impacts to the Economy\"/>\n\n<figcaption>The positive and negative impacts of tariffs. (Image by Freepik)</figcaption>\n\n<p>There are several positive effects of tariffs:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Protecting Local Jobs: </strong>Tariffs can help protect jobs in domestic industries by making it harder for foreign companies to sell their products at lower prices. This means that local workers may keep their jobs because consumers will choose domestic products over more expensive imports.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Encouraging Local Production:</strong> When foreign products become more expensive due to tariffs, consumers may choose to buy locally made items instead. This can boost local businesses and encourage them to produce more goods, leading to greater investment in domestic manufacturing capabilities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Increasing Government Revenue:</strong> Tariffs generate income for the government through taxes collected on imports. The money collected from tariffs can be used for public services like education and healthcare, which benefits society as a whole by funding important programs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Reducing Trade Deficits:</strong> By making imports more expensive, tariffs can help reduce trade deficits (when a country imports more than it exports). This can strengthen the economy over time by encouraging exports and improving trade balances with other countries.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Promoting Fair Trade Practices:</strong> Tariffs can be used as a tool against unfair trade practices by other countries. If a country subsidizes its exports or sells them at very low prices (dumping), placing tariffs can level the playing field for domestic producers who compete fairly without such advantages.</p>\n\n<h2>Negative Effects of Tariffs</h2>\n\n<p>While there are benefits to tariffs, there are also negative effects:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Higher Prices for Consumers: </strong>The most immediate effect of tariffs is that they increase prices for consumers across various sectors. Imported goods become more expensive due to added taxes, which means people have to pay more for everyday items like clothing or electronics than they would without those tariffs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Retaliation from Other Countries: </strong>Countries affected by tariffs may respond with their own tariffs on U.S. goods as retaliation. This can lead to trade wars that hurt both economies and result in even higher prices for consumers who rely on international trade for affordable products.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Impact on Domestic Industries: </strong>Not all domestic industries benefit from tariffs; some may suffer due to increased costs for raw materials that are imported from abroad. Industries that rely heavily on these materials may see reduced profits or even job losses as their operational costs rise due to higher input prices.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Economic Inefficiency: </strong>Economists argue that tariffs can lead to inefficiencies in the economy by protecting less competitive industries at the expense of consumers who pay higher prices for goods that could be cheaper if produced abroad without such taxes applied.</p>\n\n<p>5. Job Losses in Some Sectors: While some jobs may be protected by tariffs in certain industries, others may be lost in sectors that rely heavily on imports or exports affected by retaliatory measures from other countries imposing similar taxes on U.S.-made goods.</p>"

The mahjong game is played with small tiles, each marked with different symbols and characters. This game is not only popular in China but also around the world, where many people gather to play and enjoy its unique challenges.<br><br>In the mahjong game, players use skill, strategy, and a bit of luck to form winning tile combinations. The game is often played with four players, though variations exist that can accommodate three players as well. Each session of mahjong can be different, providing endless entertainment and opportunities for players to improve their skills.</p>\n\n<span></span>\n\nLearning to play mahjong can be a fun and rewarding experience. It combines elements of memory, calculation, and strategy, making it an engaging pastime for people of all ages. The game can be enjoyed casually with friends and family or competitively in tournaments.\n\n<br><br>\n\nIf you are interested in learning how to play mahjong game, you come to the right place. In this article, we will talk about how to play mahjong for beginners. From learning about the tiles and tips and tricks for new players, we will cover anything you need to know to master this exciting game. We made this guide on Tuesday (18/6/2024).\n\n<h2><b>A. Understanding the Tiles</b></h2>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p>In a mahjong game, the tiles are essential components that players use to form winning combinations. There are three main types of tiles: Suit tiles, Honor tiles, and Bonus tiles. Each type has its own unique symbols and purposes in the game.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/GM9me111XaNQ1nmpXomDEW3sVBg4yo5qxyoqdPf9.jpg\" alt=\"<b>A. Understanding the Tiles</b>\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Understanding mahjong tiles. (Photo by Mick Haupt on Unsplash)</figcaption>\n\n<h2><b>1. Suit Tiles: </b></h2>\n\n<p>Suit tiles are divided into three categories: Bamboo, Characters, and Dots. Each category has tiles numbered from one to nine. Bamboo tiles feature bamboo sticks, Character tiles have Chinese characters, and Dot tiles display circles. Each set of suit tiles contains four of each number, making a total of 36 tiles per suit. Players must learn to recognize and differentiate these tiles to form valid combinations during the game.</p>\n\n<h2><b>2. Honor Tiles:</b></h2>\n\n<p>Honor tiles include Wind tiles and Dragon tiles. There are four Wind tiles: East, South, West, and North, each represented by its respective Chinese character. Dragon tiles come in three colors: Red, Green, and White. There are four of each Wind and Dragon tile, totaling 16 Wind tiles and 12 Dragon tiles. These tiles are crucial for creating specific winning hands and often hold higher point values.</p>\n\n<h2><b>3. Bonus Tiles:</b></h2>\n\n<p>Bonus tiles consist of Flower tiles and Season tiles. There are four Flower tiles and four Season tiles, each representing different flowers and seasons. Unlike other tiles, there is only one of each Bonus tile. These tiles are not used in forming standard combinations but can provide extra points when drawn. When a player draws a Bonus tile, they usually set it aside and draw a replacement tile.</p>\n\n<span></span>\n\nEach tile in the suit categories is numbered from one to nine, and each number appears four times in a complete set of tiles. The symbols on the tiles can seem complex at first, but they are essential for forming the required sets of three (called Pungs and Chows) or four (called Kongs) tiles and pairs needed to win the game.\n\n<br><br>\n\nUnderstanding these different types of tiles is the first step in mastering the mahjong game. Knowing how to identify and use each tile effectively will help you develop strategies and improve your gameplay.\n\n<p>Playing a mahjong game involves several steps, from setting up the game to completing a winning hand. Here is a simple guide to help you get started:</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/I4xnlByGhikVLK94WjG2RTmVZ7gI2q9t3C1LMWEe.jpg\" alt=\"<b>B. How to Play Mahjong Game</b>\"/>\n\n<figcaption></figcaption>\n\n<h2><b>B. How to Play Mahjong Game</b></h2>\n\n<p><b>1. Setting Up the Game:</b> To begin, players need a set of 144 tiles, which include Suit tiles, Honor tiles, and Bonus tiles. Each player starts by building a wall of tiles in front of them. Usually, it is 18 tiles long and two tiles high, forming a square wall in the center of the table. The dealer (often decided by rolling dice) then breaks the wall, and the game begins.<br><br><b>2. Drawing and Discarding Tiles:</b> Each player starts with 13 tiles, except the dealer, who starts with 14 tiles. The game proceeds with the dealer discarding one tile to start the game. Players take turns drawing a tile from the wall and discarding a tile they don't need. The goal is to improve their hand by forming sets of tiles.<br></p>\n\n<p><b>3. Forming Sets:</b> To win a mahjong game, a player needs to form a complete hand, typically consisting of four sets and one pair. Sets can be:<br><br></p>\n\n<ul><li>Pung: Three identical tiles (e.g., three 5 Bamboos).</li></ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<ul><li>Chow: A sequence of three consecutive numbers in the same suit (e.g., 4, 5, and 6 Dots).</li></ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<ul><li>Kong: Four identical tiles (e.g., four Red Dragons), which also require an extra tile to be drawn as a replacement.</li></ul>\n\n<br>\n\nA pair is two identical tiles (e.g., two East Winds). Your goal is to be the first one that form a complete hand to win the game.\n\n<h2><b>4. Declaring and Completing a Mahjong</b></h2>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p>When a player draws or discards a tile that completes their hand, they declare \"Mahjong\" and show their hand to confirm the winning combination. If the hand is valid, that player wins the game.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/5G4u0kMmMdawERAkbDAj1nn2G1Xicbu2bLyh9529.jpg\" alt=\"<b>4.

Here are some tips to get you started:</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/37eP3B156cbNbXlgKK45jirkxbaKbEMhpBozXalv.jpg\" alt=\"<b>C.

Strategize and Avoid Rushing:</b>\n\nTake your time to plan each move carefully. Quick decisions can hinder your chances of obtaining needed tiles or inadvertently benefit your opponents.\n\n<br><br>\n\n<b>2. Keep Tiles Together:</b>\n\nResist the temptation to organize your tiles into sets prematurely. Revealing your hand can give opponents an advantage.\n\n<br><br>\n\n<b>3. Focus on Available Tiles:</b>\n\nConcentrate on matching and removing free tiles rather than being overly concerned with blocked ones.\n\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/AzqEzBDz0AA83AWbmNhknlj89w0CXmNeZggohNUQ.jpg\" alt=\"<b>4. Monitor Board Layout</b>\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Tips to play mahjong for beginners. (Image by NIDEO&amp;NICS Hokkaido from Pixabay)</figcaption>\n\n<h2><b>4. Monitor Board Layout</b></h2>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p>Pay attention to the arrangement of tiles on the board. Changes in stacks and rows can impact your strategy and reveal or block new tiles.</p>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p><b>5. Adapt Your Strategy: </b>Stay flexible and adjust your approach if your initial plan isn't yielding results. Consider alternative methods such as shifting from tile matching to forming chows.<br><br><b>6. Anticipate Future Moves: </b>Think ahead about the consequences of your actions. Consider how your decisions may influence your hand as the game progresses.<br><br><b>7. Delay Non-Advancing Moves:</b> Avoid making moves that don't move your game forward. Wait for better opportunities to arise.<br></p>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<b>8. Note Tiles of the Same Symbol:</b>\n\nWhen multiple identical tiles are available, assess each one's potential and the options they may unlock before making a move.\n\n<br><br>\n\n<b>9. Learn Tile Symbols and Locations:</b>\n\nFamiliarize yourself with tile symbols and their positions to enhance your efficiency and accuracy in matching.\n\n<br><br>\n\n<b>10. Unlock Tiles Regularly:</b>\n\nStrive to unlock at least one tile with each move, even if it doesn't immediately create a pair. This approach keeps your options open and prevents getting stuck."

Star dunes are created by opposing winds that change direction.<br><br>\"Knowing their age can help scientists understand the wind and reveal the climate of the time,\" said Prof. Geoff Duller from Aberystwyth University, who published the study with Prof. Charles Bristow from Birkbeck University.<br><br>Lala Lallia, located in the Erg Chebbi sand sea in southeastern Morocco, has been called the most complex in the world. It is 100m high, while its width is 700m.</p>\n\n<p>After its initial formation, Lala Lallia stopped growing for about 8,000 years and expanded rapidly in the last few thousand years.<br><br>Usually, deserts can be identified in the Earth's geological history, but stellar sand dunes only exist now.<br><br>Prof Duller says this may be because they are so large that experts must realize they are looking at different dunes.<br><br>\"This finding will probably surprise a lot of people because we can see how quickly these large dunes form and they move across the desert at about 50 cm per year,\" he added.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/BvEw5rLGExld9HR7WL5tVvd8wEmLVQSTBvZtcwx6.jpg\" alt=\"Scientists used luminescence dating to determine the age of the stellar sand dunes.

The method calculates when the sand grains were last exposed to sunlight.<br></h2>\n\n<p>Sand samples were taken in the dark from Morocco and analyzed in a laboratory under dim red light conditions similar to an ancient photography workshop.<br><br>Prof. Duller describes the mineral grains in the sand as \"tiny rechargeable batteries\". They store energy inside the crystals from radioactivity in the natural environment.<br><br>The longer the sand is buried underground, the more radioactivity it is exposed to and the more energy it collects.<br><br>When the grains are exposed in the lab, they release energy in the form of light, and scientists can calculate their age.</p>\n\n<p>\"In our dark laboratory, we see the light from these sand grains. The brighter the light, the older the sediment grains are and the longer they have been buried,\" says Prof. Duller.<br><br>Other large dunes include the Star Dune in Colorado, United States, which is the tallest dune in the US.

Maybe you ordered the wrong food, or something came up and you can't eat at home anymore. This happens to everyone, and DoorDash understands that customers sometimes need to make changes.</p>\n\n<p>Canceling your food order might seem difficult, but it's actually quite simple. DoorDash has made the process easy for customers to handle on their own. You don't always need to call customer service or wait for help. The app and website have built-in tools that let you cancel quickly.</p>\n\n<p>In this article, we will talk about how to cancel DoorDash order through the mobile app and the website. We will also talk about if you'll get refund after canceling your order and how to make changes to your order. We wrote this article on Thursday (26/6/2025).</p>\n\n<h2>How to Cancel DoorDash Order Through Mobile App</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/E7QE5XFlEosLWbeWaupjQiLwj2H5Itp8MOZc6dxe.jpg\" alt=\"How to Cancel DoorDash Order Through App and Website\"/>\n\n<figcaption>How to cancel DoorDash order. (Photo by  appshunter.io on Unsplash)</figcaption>\n\n<p>The mobile app is the fastest way to cancel your DoorDash order. Most people use their phones to order food, so canceling through the app is very convenient. Follow these simple steps to cancel your order quickly.</p>\n\n<p>1. Open the DoorDash app on your phone. Look for the \"Orders\" tab at the bottom of your screen and tap on it.</p>\n\n<p>2. Find the order you want to cancel from your list of recent orders. Select this order to open the order details page.</p>\n\n<p>3. Look for the \"Help\" button in the top right corner of your screen. Tap on this button to open the help menu.</p>\n\n<p>4. Look for \"Cancel Order\" in the help menu, or find the \"Cancel Order\" button directly in the order details section.</p>\n\n<p>5. Tap on the cancel option. The app will show you prompts on the screen asking why you want to cancel.</p>\n\n<p>6. Follow all the prompts and answer the questions. The app will guide you through each step until your cancellation is complete.</p>\n\n<p>Remember that you can only cancel orders that haven't been delivered yet. If your food is already on the way or has arrived, you won't be able to cancel it through the app. In special cases, like when the restaurant is closed or your driver asks you to cancel, you might need to contact customer support directly.</p>\n\n<h2>How to Cancel DoorDash Order Through the Website</h2>\n\n<p>If you prefer using a computer or don't have the mobile app, you can cancel your DoorDash order through their website. The process is similar to the mobile app but with slightly different steps. This method works well if you ordered food while working on your computer.</p>\n\n<p>1. Go to the DoorDash website and log into your account. Look for the button with three lines in the top left corner of the page.</p>\n\n<p>2. Click on the menu button (three lines) to open the main menu options.</p>\n\n<p>3. Select \"Orders\" from the menu to see all your recent food orders.</p>\n\n<p>4. Find the order you want to cancel from the list. Click on the order to open its details page.</p>\n\n<p>5. Look for the \"Help\" button on the right side of the order details page. Click on this button to open the help options.</p>\n\n<p>6. Find \"Cancel Order\" in the help section and click on it.</p>\n\n<p>7. Follow all the prompts that appear on your screen. Answer the questions about why you want to cancel and confirm your decision.</p>\n\n<h2>Will You Get a Refund After Cancelling Your Order?</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/g7utgl6UNeEwVdPFoMGjHPcbKJXWzmPsfEesu5tg.jpg\" alt=\"How to Cancel DoorDash Order Through App and Website\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Will you get a refund after cancelling your order? (Photo by DoorDash on Unsplash)</figcaption>\n\n<p>Getting a refund after canceling your DoorDash order depends on the timing of your cancellation. DoorDash has specific rules about when you can get your money back, and these rules are based on how far along your order is in the preparation and delivery process.</p>\n\n<p><strong>- Full Refund - Restaurant Has Not Confirmed Order and No Driver Assigned: </strong>If you cancel very early, before the restaurant confirms your order and before a driver is assigned, you will get a full refund. This means you get all your money back, including taxes and fees. This usually happens within the first few minutes after you place your order.</p>\n\n<p><strong>- Partial Refund - Restaurant Has Not Confirmed Order but Driver is Assigned:</strong> If a driver has been assigned to pick up your order but the restaurant hasn't confirmed it yet, you will get a partial refund. DoorDash keeps some money to cover the driver assignment costs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>- Partial Refund - Restaurant Has Confirmed Order but No Driver Assigned: </strong>If the restaurant has confirmed your order and started preparing it but no driver has been assigned yet, you will get a partial refund. Part of your payment covers the food preparation costs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>- No Refund - Restaurant Has Confirmed Order and Driver is Assigned: </strong>If both the restaurant has confirmed your order and a driver has been assigned, you will not get any refund. At this point, the restaurant is preparing your food and the driver is getting ready to pick it up. DoorDash cannot give refunds at this stage because work has already begun on your order.</p>\n\n<p><strong>- Special Circumstances May Apply: </strong>All refund decisions are made by DoorDash according to their terms and conditions. The company has the final say on whether you get money back and how much. If you have special circumstances, like a closed restaurant or driver problems, you should contact customer support for help.</p>\n\n<h2>How to Make Adjustment to Your Order</h2>\n\n<p>Sometimes you don't want to cancel your entire order. Instead, you might just want to add or remove some items. DoorDash allows you to make adjustments to your order, but only under certain conditions. This option can save you from canceling and reordering everything.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important: </strong>You can only make adjustments if the restaurant has not started processing your order yet. Once the restaurant begins preparing your food, you cannot change anything. This is why you need to act quickly if you want to make changes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>For Website Users:</strong></p>\n\n<p>1. Click on \"Help\" from the menu in the upper left corner of the DoorDash website.</p>\n\n<p>2. In the delivery help section, select your current order.</p>\n\n<p>3. Press \"Make adjustments to this order.\"</p>\n\n<p>4. Press \"Chat with Support\" to connect with a customer service agent who can help you make the changes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>For Mobile App Users:</strong></p>\n\n<p>1. Press the gray banner at the bottom of your screen or go to the \"Orders\" tab.</p>\n\n<p>2. Select your current order from the list.</p>\n\n<p>3. Press \"Help\" in the upper right corner of the screen.</p>\n\n<p>4. If available, select \"Make adjustments to this order\" and describe what changes you want to make.</p>\n\n<p>5. Press \"Submit\" to connect with an agent.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Alternative: </strong>If the adjustment option is not available, select \"Chat with Support\" to talk to a customer service representative. They will tell you if changes are possible and help you make them.</p>"

This shows that people often use Google as a quick reference tool.</p>\n\n<p>•\tHealth-related questions are very common. This suggests that many people turn to Google first when they have health concerns.</p>\n\n<p>•\tThere are lots of “how to” questions.

Here’s how:</p>\n\n<p>•\tThey show what people are interested in and worried about. For example, lots of health-related searches might show that people are concerned about their health.</p>\n\n<p>•\tThey can influence what information is available online. Popular searches often lead to more content being created about those topics.</p>\n\n<p>•\tThey can affect business and marketing. Companies often use popular search terms to decide what products to make or how to advertise.</p>\n\n<p>•\tThey can shape public opinion. If many people are searching for information on a topic, it can become a big part of public discussion.</p>\n\n<p>•\tThey can guide education and research. Frequent searches about certain topics might lead to more studies or courses being created about those subjects.</p>\n\n<p>Google searches can also reveal societal trends:</p>\n\n<p>•\tAn increase in “how to” searches might show that people are becoming more interested in learning new skills.</p>\n\n<p>•\tLots of searches about a new technology could indicate growing public interest in that area.</p>\n\n<p>•\tChanges in the types of health questions people ask might reflect shifts in health concerns over time.</p>\n\n<p>It’s important to remember that while Google searches can tell us a lot about what people are thinking about, they don’t always give the full picture. Some people might not use Google, and not all important issues become popular search topics.</p>\n\n<p>Future of Online Queries</p>\n\n<p>As technology changes, the way people search for information online is likely to change too. Here are some possible trends for the future of online queries:</p>\n\n<p>•\tVoice searches might become more common as people use smart speakers and voice assistants more often.</p>\n\n<p>•\tVisual searches could increase, with people using images to search instead of words.</p>\n\n<p>•\tArtificial intelligence might make search results more personalized, giving different answers to different people based on their needs and preferences.</p>\n\n<p>•\tSearches might become more conversational, with people asking follow-up questions as if they were talking to a person.</p>\n\n<p>•\tVirtual and augmented reality could change how people look for and interact with information.</p>\n\n<p>The types of questions people ask might also change:</p>\n\n<p>•\tAs technology advances, we might see more complex questions about new inventions and scientific discoveries.</p>\n\n<p>•\tIf climate change continues to be a big issue, we could see more searches about environmental topics.</p>\n\n<p>•\tAs the world becomes more connected, there might be more questions about global issues and different cultures.</p>\n\n<p>However, some things are likely to stay the same:</p>\n\n<p>•\tPeople will probably always need quick answers to basic questions like “What time is it?” or “How to tie a tie?”</p>\n\n<p>•\tHealth-related searches are likely to remain common as people continue to care about their wellbeing.</p>\n\n<p>•\tQuestions about current events and news will likely stay popular as people use the internet to stay informed.</p>\n\n<p>The future of online queries will depend on how technology develops and what issues become important to people. But the basic human desire to find information and answers is likely to keep driving online searches for a long time to come.</p>\n\n<p>Conclusion</p>\n\n<p>Looking at the most searched questions on Google gives us a fascinating view of what people want to know. From simple questions about time and measurements to complex queries about health and technology, these searches show the wide range of human curiosity and needs.</p>\n\n<p>We’ve seen that people often turn to Google for quick facts, how-to instructions, health information, and news updates. Entertainment and celebrity information are also very popular searches. This shows that Google serves many roles in our lives – it’s like a clock, a cookbook, a doctor, a news source, and an entertainment guide all in one.</p>\n\n<p>The trending questions of 2025 gave us a glimpse of what was important to people that year. New technologies, environmental issues, and health innovations were big topics. This shows how Google searches can reflect the changing concerns and interests of society.</p>\n\n<p>We also looked at how these popular searches can impact society, influencing everything from business decisions to public discussions. And we considered how online searches might change in the future, with new technologies potentially changing how we look for information.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, the most Googled questions tell us a lot about ourselves as humans. They show our desire to understand the world around us, to solve problems, to stay informed, and to connect with others. As long as we have questions, we’ll keep searching for answers – and Google will likely continue to be a key tool in that search.</p>"

They often give short answers or say “I don’t know.” But asking the right questions can open up amazing conversations. This article has 122 fun questions to ask kids of all ages. These questions will help you learn more about what kids think and feel. They’ll also help kids use their imagination and think in new ways.</p>\n\n<p>Introduction: The Power of Asking Questions</p>\n\n<p>Asking kids questions is about more than just getting information. It’s a way to connect with them and show you care about their thoughts and feelings. Good questions can:</p>\n\n<p>•\tHelp kids think creatively</p>\n\n<p>•\tTeach kids how to express themselves</p>\n\n<p>•\tShow kids you’re interested in their ideas</p>\n\n<p>•\tHelp you understand how kids see the world</p>\n\n<p>•\tMake kids feel important and valued</p>\n\n<p>The key is to ask open-ended questions. These are questions that can’t be answered with just “yes” or “no.” They invite kids to share more and think deeper. Let’s explore some great questions you can ask kids to get them talking!</p>\n\n<p>Everyday Questions for Kids</p>\n\n<p>These questions are perfect for starting conversations about a child’s day-to-day life:</p>\n\n<p>•\tWhat was the best thing that happened to you today?</p>\n\n<p>•\tWhat was the hardest thing you had to do today?</p>\n\n<p>•\tDid you learn anything new today?

They’re great for developing creativity and problem-solving skills.</p>\n\n<p>Questions About Favorites</p>\n\n<p>Asking about favorites is a fun way to learn more about a child’s preferences:</p>\n\n<p>•\tWhat’s your favorite food?

Many parents ask the same question. Children grow fast when they are young. This is the best time to help them reach their full height. Some simple steps can help during this important period.</p>\n\n<p>Every parent wants their child to grow strong and healthy. Height is one part of good health. Children stop growing after a certain age, usually after puberty. So, it is important to support their growth early. Giving the right foods, exercises, and sleep can make a big difference.</p>\n\n<p>If you want your children grow taller, here are eight simple tips you can follow at home.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Healthy Diet</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/k2xCZbqTVDdVEiXeGJIao3cl58h7niM4npuQDiRp.jpg\" alt=\"8 Natural Ways to Help Your Child Grow Taller\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Tips to help your children get taller.

Good nutrition helps bones grow strong and supports overall health and height.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Jumping Exercises</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/9RIuJCgeLLZvgNIYL6nuNBF56yQvbXgV08zuFywp.jpg\" alt=\"8 Natural Ways to Help Your Child Grow Taller\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Tips to help your children get taller.

They can play games that involve jumping, like hopscotch or basketball. These fun activities help stretch the body and improve blood flow. Doing jumping exercises every day can support their growing bones and muscles.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Stretching Exercises</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/AKYVrCTleb0qEDIaYe3DYsYQwSHNnR74AbbHgJFe.jpg\" alt=\"8 Natural Ways to Help Your Child Grow Taller\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Tips to help your children get taller.

Get Enough Sleep</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/HwSwNspjI1eXqcm7HN7WQ6xb1qAs64x2LyudTT5n.jpg\" alt=\"8 Natural Ways to Help Your Child Grow Taller\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Tips to help your children get taller.

Make sure your child sleeps at least 9–11 hours every night. A quiet and dark room helps them sleep better. Avoid screens before bedtime. Good sleep is key for healthy growth and development.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Hanging Exercises</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/Erj1TberrE2ZX2xml8fd0QTy1Zj7Yj1ETkPCDQAE.jpg\" alt=\"8 Natural Ways to Help Your Child Grow Taller\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Tips to help your children get taller.

They should try to hold on for 10–30 seconds. This can be repeated a few times. Hanging daily can help the spine grow and improve upper body strength.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Swimming</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/tci564lBS3mNm1QUfP8AfcUMySwWN7bh4QQQroPM.jpg\" alt=\"8 Natural Ways to Help Your Child Grow Taller\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Tips to help your children get taller.

This guide will help you understand your rights and make the best choice for your situation.</p>\n\n<h2>Understanding Disability Questions on Job Applications</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/MMFwiDQCgm1B7RTwLOVroPmoERYhvQzL6Gg5YOIK.jpg\" alt=\"How Should I Answer the Disability Question on Job Applications: A Comprehensive Guide\"/>\n\n<figcaption>How Should I Answer the Disability Question on Job Applications: A Comprehensive Guide @ 2025 trstdly.com</figcaption>\n\n<p>Many job applications ask if you have a disability. This question is usually in a section about equal opportunity. Companies ask this to:</p>\n\n<p>•\tFollow laws about hiring people with disabilities</p>\n\n<p>•\tMake their workforce more diverse</p>\n\n<p>•\tFind out if you might need help to do the job</p>\n\n<p>You usually have three choices when answering:</p>\n\n<p>•\tYes, I have a disability</p>\n\n<p>•\tNo, I don’t have a disability</p>\n\n<p>•\tI prefer not to answer</p>\n\n<p>It’s important to know that you don’t have to answer this question if you don’t want to. The law protects you from being forced to share this information.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your Legal Rights as an Applicant with a Disability</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) protects people with disabilities from job discrimination. This law says:</p>\n\n<p>•\tEmployers can’t ask about your disability before offering you a job</p>\n\n<p>•\tYou don’t have to tell an employer about your disability</p>\n\n<p>•\tIf you can do the main parts of a job with or without help, an employer can’t refuse to hire you just because of your disability</p>\n\n<p>•\tEmployers must provide reasonable accommodations if you need them to do your job</p>\n\n<p>Other countries have similar laws to protect workers with disabilities. It’s a good idea to learn about the laws in your area.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pros and Cons of Disclosing a Disability</strong></p>\n\n<p>Deciding whether to share information about your disability is a personal choice. Here are some things to think about:</p>\n\n<p>Pros of disclosing:</p>\n\n<p>•\tYou can ask for accommodations you need</p>\n\n<p>•\tIt shows honesty and openness</p>\n\n<p>•\tSome companies want to hire more people with disabilities</p>\n\n<p>•\tYou might connect with other employees who have disabilities</p>\n\n<p>Cons of disclosing:</p>\n\n<p>•\tSome employers might have wrong ideas about disabilities</p>\n\n<p>•\tYou might face discrimination, even though it’s illegal</p>\n\n<p>•\tIt could affect how people treat you at work</p>\n\n<p>•\tYou might not get the same chances as other workers</p>\n\n<p><strong>When to Disclose a Disability</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can choose to share information about your disability at different times:</p>\n\n<p>•\tOn the job application</p>\n\n<p>•\tBefore an interview</p>\n\n<p>•\tDuring an interview</p>\n\n<p>•\tAfter getting a job offer</p>\n\n<p>•\tAfter starting the job</p>\n\n<p>•\tOnly when you need an accommodation</p>\n\n<p>The best time depends on your situation. If your disability is visible or affects how you interview, you might want to tell the employer early. If it doesn’t affect your work, you might wait until after you get the job.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Disclose a Disability</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you decide to tell an employer about your disability, here are some tips:</p>\n\n<p>•\tBe clear and direct</p>\n\n<p>•\tFocus on your abilities and how you can do the job</p>\n\n<p>•\tExplain any accommodations you might need</p>\n\n<p>•\tShare only the information that’s relevant to the job</p>\n\n<p>•\tBe positive and confident</p>\n\n<p>Example: “I have a hearing impairment, but with my hearing aids, I can communicate effectively in person and on the phone. I’m excited about this opportunity and confident I can excel in this role.”</p>\n\n<h2>Requesting Reasonable Accommodations</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/jSs551g8KYirZKvDKAD3nD93w1czhZDkm04FB7F3.jpg\" alt=\"How Should I Answer the Disability Question on Job Applications: A Comprehensive Guide\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Requesting Reasonable Accommodations @ 2025 trstdly.com</figcaption>\n\n<p>Reasonable accommodations are changes that help you do your job. Some examples are:</p>\n\n<p>•\tFlexible work hours</p>\n\n<p>•\tSpecial equipment or software</p>\n\n<p>•\tChanges to your workspace</p>\n\n<p>•\tExtra breaks</p>\n\n<p>•\tHelp from an interpreter or reader</p>\n\n<p>To ask for an accommodation:</p>\n\n<p>1.\tTell your employer you need an accommodation because of a disability</p>\n\n<p>2.\tExplain what kind of help you need</p>\n\n<p>3.\tWork with your employer to find a solution that works for both of you</p>\n\n<p>Employers don’t have to provide accommodations that are too expensive or disruptive. But they should work with you to find a good solution.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Navigating the Interview Process</strong></p>\n\n<p>During job interviews, remember:</p>\n\n<p>•\tEmployers can’t ask about your disability unless you bring it up first</p>\n\n<p>•\tThey can ask if you can do the main parts of the job with or without accommodations</p>\n\n<p>•\tYou can ask for accommodations for the interview itself, like a sign language interpreter</p>\n\n<p>•\tFocus on your skills and how you can do the job well</p>\n\n<p>If you need to explain gaps in your work history due to your disability, be honest but brief. Focus on what you learned or skills you gained during that time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What Happens After Disclosure</strong></p>\n\n<p>After you tell an employer about your disability:</p>\n\n<p>•\tThey might ask for more information about your needs</p>\n\n<p>•\tYou might discuss possible accommodations</p>\n\n<p>•\tThe employer should keep your information private</p>\n\n<p>•\tYou should be treated the same as other applicants or employees</p>\n\n<p>If you feel you’re being treated unfairly after disclosing, you may want to talk to a lawyer or file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Confidentiality of Medical Information</strong></p>\n\n<p>Employers must keep your medical information private. This means:</p>\n\n<p>•\tYour medical information should be kept in a separate file, not your regular work file</p>\n\n<p>•\tOnly certain people should be able to see this information</p>\n\n<p>•\tYour boss and coworkers shouldn’t be told about your disability unless you say it’s okay</p>\n\n<p>•\tInformation about your disability shouldn’t be shared with other companies</p>\n\n<p>If you think your privacy has been violated, you can file a complaint with the EEOC.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dealing with Potential Discrimination</strong></p>\n\n<p>Even though it’s illegal, some people with disabilities still face discrimination at work. Signs of discrimination might include:</p>\n\n<p>•\tNot being hired because of your disability</p>\n\n<p>•\tBeing passed over for promotions</p>\n\n<p>•\tGetting paid less than other workers doing the same job</p>\n\n<p>•\tBeing left out of work events or training</p>\n\n<p>•\tHaving your accommodation requests ignored</p>\n\n<p>If you think you’re being discriminated against:</p>\n\n<p>1.\tDocument everything that happens</p>\n\n<p>2.\tTalk to your boss or HR department</p>\n\n<p>3.\tFile a complaint with the EEOC if the problem isn’t fixed</p>\n\n<p>4.\tConsider talking to a lawyer who specializes in disability rights</p>\n\n<h2>Self-Advocacy in the Workplace</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/pKxHeUnJVXpeZjL9XEtbDl6X6raQQGaHycwaj8ZB.jpg\" alt=\"How Should I Answer the Disability Question on Job Applications: A Comprehensive Guide\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Self-Advocacy in the Workplace @ 2025 trstdly.com</figcaption>\n\n<p>Being your own advocate means speaking up for yourself and your needs. Here are some tips:</p>\n\n<p>•\tKnow your rights under the ADA and other laws</p>\n\n<p>•\tBe clear about what you need to do your job well</p>\n\n<p>•\tKeep records of your work accomplishments</p>\n\n<p>•\tBuild good relationships with your coworkers and boss</p>\n\n<p>•\tJoin employee resource groups for people with disabilities if your company has them</p>\n\n<p>•\tStay informed about new technologies or accommodations that might help you</p>\n\n<p>Remember, you are the expert on your own needs and abilities. Don’t be afraid to speak up for yourself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Resources for Job Seekers with Disabilities</strong></p>\n\n<p>Many organizations offer help to people with disabilities who are looking for jobs:</p>\n\n<p>•\tVocational Rehabilitation Services: These state agencies help people with disabilities find and keep jobs</p>\n\n<p>•\tJob Accommodation Network (JAN): Offers free advice about workplace accommodations</p>\n\n<p>•\tEARN (Employer Assistance and Resource Network on Disability Inclusion): Helps employers hire and keep workers with disabilities</p>\n\n<p>•\tDisabilityIN: A business network that helps companies become more inclusive</p>\n\n<p>•\tLocal Centers for Independent Living: Offer job search help and other services</p>\n\n<p>These groups can help you find job openings, prepare for interviews, and understand your rights.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Understanding the Employer’s Perspective</strong></p>\n\n<p>Employers have to balance many things when hiring. They might worry about:</p>\n\n<p>•\tThe cost of accommodations</p>\n\n<p>•\tHow a disability might affect job performance</p>\n\n<p>•\tSafety concerns</p>\n\n<p>•\tHow to create an inclusive workplace</p>\n\n<p>But many employers are learning that hiring people with disabilities is good for business. It can:</p>\n\n<p>•\tBring new perspectives and ideas</p>\n\n<p>•\tImprove company image</p>\n\n<p>•\tHelp them serve customers with disabilities better</p>\n\n<p>•\tMake the workplace more flexible for everyone</p>\n\n<p>Understanding these concerns can help you address them in your application or interview.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Success Stories and Positive Outcomes</strong></p>\n\n<p>Many people with disabilities have successful careers. Here are a few examples:</p>\n\n<p>•\tStephen Hawking: Famous scientist who had ALS</p>\n\n<p>•\tMarlee Matlin: Deaf actress who won an Oscar</p>\n\n<p>•\tTemple Grandin: Animal scientist with autism who revolutionized livestock handling</p>\n\n<p>•\tJim Abbott: Professional baseball player born without a right hand</p>\n\n<p>These stories show that disabilities don’t have to limit career success. Many companies are now actively seeking to hire people with disabilities because they recognize their talents and unique perspectives.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Future Trends in Disability Employment</strong></p>\n\n<p>The world of work is changing, and this affects people with disabilities too. Some trends to watch:</p>\n\n<p>•\tRemote work: This can open up more opportunities for people who have trouble commuting</p>\n\n<p>•\tArtificial Intelligence: Could help with accommodations but might also create new challenges</p>\n\n<p>•\tGig economy: Offers flexible work but might not provide the same protections as traditional jobs</p>\n\n<p>•\tUniversal Design: Making workplaces accessible for everyone from the start</p>\n\n<p>•\tIncreased awareness: More companies are focusing on disability inclusion</p>\n\n<p>Staying informed about these trends can help you plan your career and find new opportunities.</p>\n\n<h2>A Global Perspective on Disability Employment</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/AxQJ71m8QhjhcCzCKjG5Iymujg54ue18CQlFGi4l.jpg\" alt=\"How Should I Answer the Disability Question on Job Applications: A Comprehensive Guide\"/>\n\n<figcaption>A Global Perspective on Disability Employment @ 2025 trstdly.com</figcaption>\n\n<p>Disability rights and employment practices vary around the world. Some key points:</p>\n\n<p>•\tMany countries have laws similar to the ADA, but enforcement varies</p>\n\n<p>•\tSome countries have quotas for hiring people with disabilities</p>\n\n<p>•\tCultural attitudes towards disability can affect job opportunities</p>\n\n<p>•\tInternational organizations like the UN are working to improve disability rights globally</p>\n\n<p>If you’re considering working in another country, research their disability laws and cultural attitudes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Technology and Accessibility in the Workplace</strong></p>\n\n<p>Technology is making work more accessible for many people with disabilities:</p>\n\n<p>•\tScreen readers and voice recognition software for people with visual impairments</p>\n\n<p>•\tVideo relay services for deaf employees</p>\n\n<p>•\tErgonomic equipment for people with physical disabilities</p>\n\n<p>•\tApps that help with organization and time management for people with cognitive disabilities</p>\n\n<p>Staying up-to-date with new technologies can help you find new ways to succeed at work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mental Health and Invisible Disabilities</strong></p>\n\n<p>Not all disabilities are visible. Mental health conditions and other invisible disabilities present unique challenges:</p>\n\n<p>•\tDeciding whether to disclose can be especially difficult</p>\n\n<p>•\tYou might face skepticism if your disability isn’t obvious</p>\n\n<p>•\tAccommodations might be different, like flexible schedules or quiet workspaces</p>\n\n<p>Remember, invisible disabilities are just as valid as visible ones. You have the same rights to accommodations and fair treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Disability as Part of Workplace Diversity and Inclusion</p>\n\n<p>Many companies now see disability as an important part of diversity:</p>\n\n<p>•\tDisability employee resource groups are becoming more common</p>\n\n<p>•\tSome companies have specific goals for hiring people with disabilities</p>\n\n<p>•\tDisability awareness training is increasing</p>\n\n<p>•\tMore companies are making their products and services accessible</p>\n\n<p>This shift can create more opportunities and a better work environment for people with disabilities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Education and Training Opportunities</strong></p>\n\n<p>Continuing education can help advance your career:</p>\n\n<p>•\tMany colleges have disability services offices to help with accommodations</p>\n\n<p>•\tOnline courses can be a flexible option</p>\n\n<p>•\tVocational training programs might offer specialized help</p>\n\n<p>•\tSome scholarships are specifically for students with disabilities</p>\n\n<p>Don’t let your disability stop you from pursuing more education or training. There are often resources available to help you succeed.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Deciding how to answer disability questions on job applications is a personal choice. There’s no one right answer for everyone. Consider your specific situation, the job you’re applying for, and what you’re comfortable sharing.</p>\n\n<p>Remember your rights:</p>\n\n<p>– You don’t have to disclose a disability if you don’t want to</p>\n\n<p>– If you can do the main parts of the job, employers can’t discriminate against you</p>\n\n<p>– You can ask for reasonable accommodations if you need them</p>\n\n<p>Whether you choose to disclose or not, focus on your skills and what you can bring to the job. With the right preparation and mindset, you can find a job where you can thrive.</p>\n\n<p>If you face challenges, don’t give up. There are many resources and organizations that can help you in your job search and career. Your disability is just one part of who you are, and it doesn’t define your worth as an employee or a person.</p>"

How To Make Candles At Home</h2>\n\n<h2>Materials Needed:</h2>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<ul><li><b>Wax:</b> Choose a wax suitable for candle making, such as paraffin, soy, or beeswax. Each type of wax has its unique characteristics, so pick one that aligns with your preferences.</li></ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<ul><li><b>Wick: </b>Select a wick of the appropriate size for your chosen wax. The size of the wick determines how well the candle burns.</li></ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<ul><li><b>Fragrance Oil (optional): </b>If you want scented candles, choose a fragrance oil that complements your preferences. Make sure it's designed for candle making.</li></ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<ul><li><b>Double Boiler or Microwave-Safe Container:</b> For melting the wax, use a double boiler or a microwave-safe container. Ensure it's heat-resistant.</li></ul>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<ul><li><b style=\"background-color: var(--colorset); color: rgba(0,0,0,var(--tw-text-opacity)); font-family: var(--font-primary1);\">Thermometer: </b><span>To monitor the wax temperature and ensure it doesn't overheat.

You can use containers like jars or aluminum molds, depending on your design preference.</li></ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<ul><li><b>Hot Glue Gun </b>(if using a container): Secure the wick at the bottom of the container.</li></ul>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/iMeTeTqbzGfwsB4KcVpHszgyivf6eiKLvz75ZM6C.jpg\" alt=\"Steps:\"/>\n\n<figcaption>How to make candles at home. (Photo by Ron Lach on Pexels)</figcaption>\n\n<h2>Steps:</h2>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p><b>1. Prepare the Workspace:</b> Set up your work area with all the necessary materials. Cover surfaces to make cleanup easier.<br></p>\n\n<p><b>2. Wick Placement: </b>If using a container, use a hot glue gun to secure the wick at the bottom. For molds, thread the wick through the center hole.<br><br><b>3. Wax Melting:</b> Melt the wax using a double boiler or a microwave-safe container. Monitor the temperature with a thermometer and avoid overheating.<br><br><b>4. Adding Fragrance and Dye:</b> If desired, add fragrance oil and dye to the melted wax. Stir thoroughly to ensure an even distribution.<br><br><b>5. Pouring the Wax:</b> Carefully pour the melted wax into the chosen candle containers or molds, leaving about half an inch from the top.<br></p>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<b>6. Cooling and Trimming: </b>\n\nAllow the candle to cool completely. Trim the wick to the desired length (usually around half an inch above the wax).\n\n<br><br>\n\n<b>7. Final Touches:</b>\n\nOnce the candle is fully set, you can add personal touches like labeling or decorating the container.\n\n<br><br>\n\n<b>8. Enjoy Your Homemade Candle:</b>\n\nOnce everything is set, light your candle and relish in the satisfaction of creating your very own personalized home accessory.\n\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/Do2mmoCtXfuZLdLILm9p0LlnIce8rvs3twCLch7W.jpg\" alt=\"B. 7 Tips To Make Great Candles At Home\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Tips to make great homemade candles. (Photo by Yan Krukau on Pexels)</figcaption>\n\n<h2>B. 7 Tips To Make Great Candles At Home</h2>\n\n<p><b>1. Quality Fragrance Oils: </b>If you want to make strong-scented candles, make sure to use high-quality fragrance oils designed for candle making. Cheaper alternatives may not provide a robust scent throw.<br><br><b>2. Scent Combining: </b>Experiment with combining different fragrance oils to create unique scents. Just make sure that the combinations are harmonious for a pleasant aroma.<br><br><b>3. Allow for Cure Time: </b>Let your candles cure or \"age\" for a few days after making them. This allows the fragrance to fully incorporate with the wax. This will help to enhance the scent.</p>\n\n<p>Pour the fragrance-infused wax at an optimal temperature, typically around 170-180°F (77-82°C). You can use a candy thermometer to check the temperature before you pour it. This helps the fragrance bind better with the wax.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/aAWTmMM1evkKryNHoBWPHgFRHprZnqN7BX0kXiRw.jpg\" alt=\"4. Optimal Pouring Temperature\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Make sure to pour the candle at the perfect temperature. (Photo by Ron Lach on Pexels)</figcaption>\n\n<h2>4. Optimal Pouring Temperature</h2>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<b>5. Stirring Technique:</b>\n\nStir the fragrance oil into the melted wax thoroughly but gently. Aggressive stirring can introduce air bubbles, affecting the scent throw.\n\n<br><br>\n\n<b>6. Mindful Wick Trimming: </b>\n\nTrim the wick appropriately. A longer wick can create a larger flame that burns through the fragrance more quickly.\n\n<br><br>\n\n<b>7. Use the Right Candle Wick: </b>\n\nThe size and type of wick can impact scent throw. A properly sized wick ensures an even burn, allowing the fragrance to disperse effectively.\n\n<br>"

Many people rely on medication to manage their blood pressure, but there are also natural remedies that can help, such as coconut water.<br><br>Coconut water is the clear liquid found inside young coconuts. It is not only delicious and refreshing, but it also contains several nutrients that can contribute to better health, including potassium and magnesium. These minerals are essential for maintaining a healthy blood pressure level.<br><br>Potassium plays a crucial role in regulating blood pressure by counteracting the effects of sodium. Sodium is a mineral that can cause fluid retention and increase blood volume, leading to higher blood pressure. By consuming coconut water, which is rich in potassium, you can help balance the sodium levels in your body and lower your blood pressure.<br><br>Magnesium is another mineral found in coconut water that can help lower blood pressure. It works by relaxing the muscles in the blood vessels, allowing for better blood flow and reducing the strain on the heart. This can help prevent hypertension and its associated complications.<br><br>In addition to its mineral content, coconut water is also a natural diuretic. This means that it can increase urine production and promote the elimination of excess fluid and sodium from the body. By reducing fluid retention, coconut water can help lower blood pressure.<br><br>It's important to note that while coconut water can be beneficial for managing high blood pressure, it should not replace prescribed medication or medical advice. It is always recommended to consult with a healthcare professional before making any changes to your treatment plan.<br><br>In conclusion, coconut water is a natural remedy that can help lower high blood pressure. Its potassium and magnesium content, along with its diuretic properties, make it a great addition to a balanced diet for those looking to manage their blood pressure levels. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and guidance. © 2024 maverick</figcaption>\n\n<h2>Supporting Heart Health</h2>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p>Another benefit of coconut milk is that it helps maintain heart health. A study published in the Journal of Nutrition and Metabolism states that consuming coconut milk can lower bad cholesterol and increase good cholesterol by up to 18 percent.</p>\n\n<h2>Lowering Blood Pressure</h2>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p>The presence of minerals such as potassium, sodium, calcium, and iron in coconut milk can help lower blood pressure. This works by improving blood circulation and keeping blood vessels relaxed and free from blockages.</p>\n\n<h2>Preventing Blood Sugar Spikes</h2>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p>The content found in coconut milk can help slow down the rise of blood sugar in the blood vessels. This prevents an increase in blood sugar levels and reduces the potential for diabetes to occur.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/SGqLIUiG2jQq05iKhw9v0CkS9bhCqqqMAKimpFjm.jpg\" alt=\"Preventing Blood Sugar Spikes\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Diabetes adalah kondisi medis kronis yang ditandai dengan tingginya kadar gula darah dalam tubuh. Kondisi ini terjadi ketika tubuh tidak dapat memproduksi atau menggunakan insulin dengan baik. Insulin adalah hormon yang diproduksi oleh pankreas dan berperan dalam mengatur kadar gula darah.<br><br>Ada dua jenis diabetes yang paling umum, yaitu diabetes tipe 1 dan tipe 2. Diabetes tipe 1 terjadi ketika pankreas tidak dapat memproduksi insulin sama sekali. Ini biasanya terjadi pada anak-anak dan remaja. Diabetes tipe 2, di sisi lain, terjadi ketika tubuh tidak dapat menggunakan insulin dengan efektif atau tidak memproduksi cukup insulin. Ini biasanya terjadi pada orang dewasa yang lebih tua, tetapi juga dapat terjadi pada anak-anak dan remaja.<br><br>Gejala diabetes meliputi sering buang air kecil, haus yang berlebihan, penurunan berat badan yang tidak dapat dijelaskan, kelelahan, dan luka yang sulit sembuh. Jika tidak diobati, diabetes dapat menyebabkan komplikasi serius seperti kerusakan ginjal, gangguan penglihatan, kerusakan saraf, dan penyakit jantung.<br><br>Pengobatan diabetes melibatkan mengatur pola makan sehat, berolahraga secara teratur, dan mengontrol kadar gula darah. Pada diabetes tipe 1, pasien harus menggunakan suntikan insulin untuk menggantikan hormon yang tidak diproduksi oleh pankreas. Pada diabetes tipe 2, dokter mungkin meresepkan obat-obatan untuk membantu tubuh menggunakan insulin dengan lebih efektif.<br><br>Pencegahan diabetes melibatkan menjaga pola makan yang sehat, berolahraga secara teratur, dan menjaga berat badan yang sehat. Penting juga untuk menghindari konsumsi makanan tinggi gula dan lemak jenuh. Pembatasan konsumsi alkohol dan berhenti merokok juga dapat membantu mengurangi risiko diabetes.<br><br>Dalam kesimpulannya, diabetes adalah kondisi medis kronis yang mempengaruhi tingkat gula darah dalam tubuh. Ini dapat mempengaruhi kualitas hidup seseorang jika tidak diobati dengan baik. Oleh karena itu, penting untuk menjaga pola makan yang sehat, berolahraga secara teratur, dan mengontrol kadar gula darah untuk mencegah dan mengelola diabetes. © 2023 maverick</figcaption>\n\n<h2>Preventing Inflammation</h2>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p>The anti-inflammatory content found in lauric acid in coconut milk can help reduce inflammation. This is related to conditions such as joint inflammation and joint pain.</p>\n\n<h2>Improving Digestion</h2>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Coconut milk can be a healthy choice that aids digestion. Coconut milk is able to enhance the growth of gut microbiota and improve gut health.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/sbSDvOldTgvErOUJ3KqgaEwtX0keS3rtZYO4Wa9V.jpg\" alt=\"8 Health Benefits of Consuming Coconut Milk in Food and Drinks\"/>\n\n<figcaption>The coconut milk content in food and drinks can have health effects on our body.

They organize rallies, marches, and other events to highlight the injustices faced by Palestinians and call for a just and peaceful resolution to the conflict.<br><br>One of the main reasons behind the surge in pro-Palestine demonstrations is the growing concern over the Israeli government's policies towards the Palestinians.

It makes the perfect dessert for special occasions or when you want something extra sweet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>For the crust:</strong></p>\n\n<p>- 1 cup almond flour</p>\n\n<p>- 3 tablespoons melted butter</p>\n\n<p>- 2 tablespoons powdered erythritol</p>\n\n<p>- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>\n\n<p><strong>For the filling:</strong></p>\n\n<p>- 24 oz cream cheese (room temperature)</p>\n\n<p>- 3/4 cup powdered erythritol</p>\n\n<p>- 3 large eggs</p>\n\n<p>- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>\n\n<p>- 1/4 cup heavy cream</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n\n<p>1. Heat your oven to 325°F. Line a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</p>\n\n<p>2. Make the crust by mixing almond flour, melted butter, erythritol, and vanilla in a bowl. Press this mixture firmly into the bottom of your prepared pan.</p>\n\n<p>3. Bake the crust for 10 minutes until it turns light golden brown. Remove from oven and let it cool while you make the filling.</p>\n\n<p>4. Beat the cream cheese in a large bowl until it becomes smooth and fluffy. Add the erythritol and mix well until completely combined.</p>\n\n<p>5. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in vanilla extract and heavy cream until the filling is smooth.</p>\n\n<p>6. Pour the filling over the cooled crust and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 45-50 minutes until the center is almost set.</p>\n\n<p>7. Cool completely at room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours before serving. This helps the cheesecake set properly.</p>\n\n<h2>Keto Peanut Butter Cookies Recipe</h2>\n\n<p>These soft and chewy cookies taste like traditional peanut butter cookies but with much fewer carbs. They are perfect for afternoon snacks or packed lunches.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ingredients: </strong></p>\n\n<p>- 1 cup natural peanut butter (no sugar added)</p>\n\n<p>- 1/2 cup erythritol</p>\n\n<p>- 1 large egg</p>\n\n<p>- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>\n\n<p>- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda</p>\n\n<p>- 1/4 teaspoon salt</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instructions: </strong></p>\n\n<p>1. Preheat your oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper to prevent the cookies from sticking.</p>\n\n<p>2. Mix all ingredients in a large bowl until they form a smooth dough. The mixture should hold together well when you squeeze it.</p>\n\n<p>3. Roll the dough into 1-inch balls and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Leave about 2 inches between each cookie for spreading.</p>\n\n<p>4. Use a fork to press down on each cookie ball, making a crisscross pattern on top. This gives them the classic peanut butter cookie look.</p>\n\n<p>5. Bake for 10-12 minutes until the edges turn light golden brown. The centers may look slightly underbaked, but they will continue cooking as they cool.</p>\n\n<p>6. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before moving them to a wire rack. This prevents them from breaking apart.</p>\n\n<h2>Keto Brownies Recipe</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/L1OiLPuqkMls34iFugot9jThTmUG7l1PwMLFGqGP.jpg\" alt=\"6 Keto Dessert Recipes to Satisfy Your Sweettooth\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Keto brownies recipe. (Photo by Molly Keesling on Unsplash)</figcaption>\n\n<p>Rich and fudgy, these brownies satisfy any chocolate craving without breaking your diet. They have a deep chocolate flavor that rivals any traditional brownie recipe.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>\n\n<p>- 1/2 cup coconut flour</p>\n\n<p>- 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</p>\n\n<p>- 1/2 cup erythritol</p>\n\n<p>- 1/3 cup melted coconut oil</p>\n\n<p>- 3 large eggs</p>\n\n<p>- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>\n\n<p>- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder</p>\n\n<p>- 1/4 teaspoon salt</p>\n\n<p>- 1/2 cup sugar-free chocolate chips (optional)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n\n<p>1. Preheat your oven to 350°F. Line an 8x8 inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving some overhang for easy removal.</p>\n\n<p>2. Whisk together coconut flour, cocoa powder, erythritol, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl until well combined.</p>\n\n<p>3. In another bowl, beat the eggs, then add melted coconut oil and vanilla extract. Mix until smooth and well blended.</p>\n\n<p>4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix, as this can make the brownies tough.</p>\n\n<p>5. Fold in chocolate chips if using. Spread the batter evenly in your prepared pan and smooth the top with a spatula.</p>\n\n<p>6. Bake for 25-30 minutes until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. Do not overbake.</p>\n\n<p>7. Cool completely in the pan before cutting into squares. This allows the brownies to set and makes them easier to cut cleanly.</p>\n\n<h2>Keto Ice Cream Recipe</h2>\n\n<p>This creamy vanilla ice cream is refreshing and satisfying on hot days. You can enjoy it plain or add your favorite keto-friendly toppings.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>\n\n<p>- 2 cups heavy cream</p>\n\n<p>- 1 cup unsweetened almond milk</p>\n\n<p>- 3/4 cup erythritol</p>\n\n<p>- 6 egg yolks</p>\n\n<p>- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract</p>\n\n<p>- 1/4 teaspoon salt</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n\n<p>1. Heat the heavy cream and almond milk in a medium saucepan over medium heat until small bubbles form around the edges. Do not let it boil.</p>\n\n<p>2. Whisk egg yolks and erythritol in a separate bowl until the mixture becomes pale and thick. This usually takes about 2-3 minutes of vigorous whisking.</p>\n\n<p>3. Slowly pour half of the hot cream mixture into the egg yolks while whisking constantly. This prevents the eggs from cooking too quickly.</p>\n\n<p>4. Pour the egg mixture back into the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until it coats the back of a spoon. This takes about 5-7 minutes.</p>\n\n<p>5. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract and salt. Strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve to remove any lumps.</p>\n\n<p>6. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours until completely cold. Churn in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer instructions.</p>\n\n<p>7. Transfer to a freezer-safe container and freeze for at least 2 hours before serving for the best texture.</p>\n\n<h2>Keto Fudge Recipe</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/qRqfbNH8Zy06Zzr2pjIEQWpFl289ssgMVjvEovKt.jpg\" alt=\"6 Keto Dessert Recipes to Satisfy Your Sweettooth\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Keto fudge recipe.

Line an 8x8 inch pan with parchment paper, leaving overhang for easy removal of the finished fudge.</p>\n\n<p>2. Melt coconut oil in a small saucepan over low heat or in the microwave for 30-second intervals until completely liquid.</p>\n\n<p>3. Whisk in cocoa powder until smooth and no lumps remain. Add powdered erythritol and whisk until completely dissolved.</p>\n\n<p>4. Remove from heat and stir in almond butter, vanilla extract, and salt until the mixture is smooth and glossy.</p>\n\n<p>5. Pour the mixture into your prepared pan and spread evenly with a spatula. Tap the pan gently to remove air bubbles.</p>\n\n<p>6. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours until firm. Cut into small squares and store in the refrigerator for best results.</p>\n\n<h2>Keto Lemon Bar Recipe</h2>\n\n<p>These tangy lemon bars have a buttery almond flour crust and a bright lemon filling.

Preheat your oven to 350°F. Line an 8x8 inch baking pan with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>\n\n<p>2. Mix all crust ingredients in a bowl until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Press firmly into the bottom of your prepared pan.</p>\n\n<p>3. Bake the crust for 15 minutes until it turns light golden brown around the edges. Remove from oven but keep the oven on.</p>\n\n<p>4. Whisk together all filling ingredients in a bowl until smooth and well combined. Make sure there are no lumps of flour.</p>\n\n<p>5. Pour the lemon filling over the hot crust and return to the oven. Bake for 20-25 minutes until the filling is set and no longer jiggles.</p>\n\n<p>6. Cool completely at room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours.

Many of us enjoy them every day. However, does adding sugar to our coffee or tea have a significant impact on our health?<br><br>According to Medical News Today, a recent study analyzing data from the Copenhagen Male Study provides interesting insights on this issue.</p>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p>In the study, researchers from Denmark, the Netherlands, and England collected data from the Copenhagen Male longitudinal study. They were interested in finding out whether adding sugar to coffee or tea could increase the risk of developing diabetes, death from heart disease or cancer, and overall mortality risk.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/VhvU1POQDN3Euf7w1UDx58LW41kdpZNNTCnmm3uH.jpg\" alt=\"Health Impact of Adding Sugar to Our Coffee and Tea\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Green Tea Illustration<br><br>Green tea is a popular beverage that is enjoyed by people all over the world. It is made from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant, which are steamed and dried to preserve their natural properties.<br><br>One of the key benefits of green tea is its high antioxidant content. Antioxidants help to protect the body against damage caused by free radicals, which are unstable molecules that can lead to chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer. Green tea is particularly rich in a type of antioxidant called catechins, which have been shown to have various health benefits.<br><br>Drinking green tea regularly has been associated with a reduced risk of heart disease. Studies have found that the catechins in green tea can help to lower blood pressure and improve blood lipid levels, which are both risk factors for heart disease. Green tea has also been found to have a positive effect on cholesterol levels, reducing LDL (bad) cholesterol and increasing HDL (good) cholesterol.<br><br>Green tea may also help with weight management. It has been found to increase fat oxidation and boost metabolism, which can help to promote weight loss. Additionally, green tea contains caffeine, which can help to increase energy expenditure and fat burning.<br><br>In addition to its physical health benefits, green tea has also been found to have positive effects on mental health. It contains an amino acid called L-theanine, which has been shown to promote relaxation and reduce stress levels. This can help to improve mood and overall well-being.<br><br>To enjoy the benefits of green tea, it is recommended to drink 2-3 cups per day. Green tea can be enjoyed hot or cold and can be flavored with lemon or honey for added taste. It is important to note that green tea does contain caffeine, so it is best to consume it in moderation, especially for those who are sensitive to caffeine.<br><br>In conclusion, green tea is a healthy beverage that offers numerous health benefits. From its high antioxidant content to its potential to aid in weight management and promote mental well-being, green tea is a great addition to a balanced diet. So why not start incorporating green tea into your daily routine and reap the benefits it has to offer? © 2023 maverick</figcaption>\n\n<span></span>\n\nAs a preliminary information, excessive consumption of sugar in one's diet can lead to health problems, including tooth decay, obesity, and heart disease. Therefore, it is important to understand the impact of adding sugar to our favorite drinks.\n\n<br><br>\n\nThis study used data from the Copenhagen Male Study, which started in the 1970s. The study involved Danish men aged 40-59 when the study began.\n\n<br><br>\n\nParticipants in this study underwent a number of initial health examinations, including assessments of heart and lung health. They were also asked to fill out a questionnaire about their lifestyle.\n\n<span></span>\n\nDuring the follow-up visit, the doctors measured the participants' blood pressure, height, and weight. The participants were also asked to fill out a questionnaire that asked whether they added sugar to their coffee or tea.\n\n<br><br>\n\nIn this study, data from 2,923 eligible men were used for analysis. All of these men had no history of heart disease, cancer, or type 2 diabetes prior to joining the study. They also all reported drinking coffee or tea.\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/ISfe0Ui6nlCQxwJN5qhWCYq0dcF2JGlRfe8ateSp.jpg\" alt=\"Health Impact of Adding Sugar to Our Coffee and Tea\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Coffee is one of the most popular beverages in the world. It is enjoyed by people of all ages and backgrounds. Coffee is made from the roasted seeds of the Coffea plant. These seeds, commonly known as coffee beans, are then ground and brewed with hot water to create the beverage that we all know and love.<br><br>There are many different types of coffee beans, each with its own unique flavor profile. Some of the most popular varieties include Arabica and Robusta. Arabica beans are known for their smooth and mild flavor, while Robusta beans have a stronger and more bitter taste.<br><br>Coffee is not only delicious, but it also contains caffeine, a natural stimulant. Caffeine is known to increase alertness and improve concentration. That's why many people start their day with a cup of coffee to help them wake up and stay focused.<br><br>In addition to its energizing effects, coffee also has several health benefits. Studies have shown that regular coffee consumption may help reduce the risk of certain diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and liver cancer. Coffee is also rich in antioxidants, which can help protect the body against damage from harmful free radicals.<br><br>However, it is important to consume coffee in moderation. Too much caffeine can lead to negative side effects, such as insomnia, nervousness, and increased heart rate. It is recommended to limit your daily caffeine intake to about 400 milligrams, which is roughly equivalent to four cups of coffee.<br><br>Overall, coffee is a beloved beverage enjoyed by millions of people around the world. Whether you prefer it black, with milk, or with a dash of sugar, there is a coffee out there for everyone. So go ahead, grab a cup of joe, and savor the rich flavors and aromas of this wonderful beverage. © 2023 maverick</figcaption>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p>The results of this study indicate that adding sugar to coffee or tea does not pose any significant additional health risks. The researchers did not ask the participants how much sugar they added to their drinks, but they assumed that the amount was small.</p>\n\n<span></span>\n\nWhen scientists compared the group that added sugar to their drinks with the group that did not add sugar, they did not find a significant difference in overall risk of death, death from heart disease, death from cancer, or risk of type 2 diabetes. This means that adding sugar to coffee or tea does not seem to have a major impact on health.\n\n<br><br>\n\nThe group that added sugar to their drinks had a death rate of 89.9 percent, while the group without sugar had a death rate of 87.5 percent. Similarly, there were no significant statistical differences in other health risks.\n\n<span></span>\n\nDr. Sarah Stombaugh, a family physician not involved in this study, evaluated the findings. \"Adding a little sugar to our diet can be done without serious risks,\" explained Dr. Stombaugh. This suggests that adding sugar to the coffee or tea we make at home doesn't have to be a major health concern.\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p>Dr. Stombaugh also noted that this research focuses on adding sugar to coffee or tea made at home.

By focusing on homemade coffee or tea drinks, we can reduce the risk of greater health impacts that are often associated with modern sweetened beverages.\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p>When it comes to maintaining our health, it is important to pay attention to our overall sugar intake in our diet, not just from coffee or tea.

Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This helps regulate your body's internal clock and promotes better sleep patterns.<br><br>2. Create a Relaxing Bedtime Routine:<br>Establishing a relaxing bedtime routine can signal your body that it's time to wind down and prepare for sleep. This routine can include activities such as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation.<br><br>3. Create a Comfortable Sleep Environment:<br>Ensure that your bedroom is a comfortable and inviting space for sleep. Keep the room cool, dark, and quiet. Invest in a good quality mattress and pillows that provide adequate support for your body. Consider using blackout curtains, earplugs, or a white noise machine if external noise or light is a disturbance.<br><br>4. Limit Exposure to Electronic Devices Before Bed:<br>The blue light emitted by electronic devices like smartphones, tablets, and computers can disrupt your sleep. Try to limit their use at least an hour before bedtime. Instead, engage in activities that promote relaxation and prepare your mind for sleep.<br><br>5. Avoid Stimulants and Heavy Meals Before Bed:<br>Consuming stimulants like caffeine or nicotine close to bedtime can interfere with your ability to fall asleep. Additionally, having a heavy meal before bed can cause discomfort and indigestion. It's best to avoid these substances and opt for lighter, healthier snacks if needed.<br><br>6. Exercise Regularly:<br>Regular physical activity can significantly improve sleep quality. Engaging in moderate-intensity exercises like walking, jogging, or yoga can help promote better sleep. However, try to finish your workout at least a few hours before bedtime to allow your body to wind down.<br><br>7. Manage Stress:<br>Stress and anxiety are common contributors to sleep problems. Finding effective ways to manage stress can help improve your sleep. Consider techniques like journaling, practicing mindfulness, or seeking professional help if needed.<br><br>Conclusion:<br>By implementing these simple tips, you can enhance your sleep quality and wake up feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. Remember, good sleep is crucial for your overall health and well-being, so prioritize it and make it a priority in your daily routine.</figcaption>\n\n<h2>Nutritional Content</h2>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p>In general, robusta coffee beans contain less fat and sugar compared to arabica coffee beans.

Airplane! (1980)</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/66gXcGC5QX17mI1YKzoekx2ugcZ5eeIIvixeqbmS.jpg\" alt=\"5 Funniest Parody Movies That Will Makes You LOL\"/>\n\n<figcaption>5 Funniest Parody Movies That Will Makes You LOL © 2025 Trstdly.com</figcaption>\n\n<p>One of the greatest parody movies of all time, Airplane! is a spoof of 1970s disaster films, particularly Zero Hour! and Airport 1975.</p>\n\n<p>Packed with absurd jokes, slapstick comedy, and ridiculous one-liners, this film follows a former pilot with a fear of flying who must land a commercial airplane when the crew falls ill.</p>\n\n<p>The film's deadpan humor and rapid-fire gags, like “Surely, you can’t be serious” – “I am serious, and don’t call me Shirley,” make it a timeless classic.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Spaceballs (1987)</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/DMzqBeCtqEQmR3Yvr3B4y9wHD1vL4qHJXXl6i9JT.jpg\" alt=\"5 Funniest Parody Movies That Will Makes You LOL\"/>\n\n<figcaption>5 Funniest Parody Movies That Will Makes You LOL © 2025 Trstdly.com</figcaption>\n\n<p>Mel Brooks delivers a hilarious Star Wars parody with Spaceballs, which pokes fun at the sci-fi genre.</p>\n\n<p>The film follows Lone Starr and his sidekick Barf as they try to stop the evil Dark Helmet from stealing the air supply of planet Druidia.</p>\n\n<p>From ridiculous merchandise jokes (“Spaceballs: The Flamethrower!”) to a character literally named Yogurt (a parody of Yoda), this movie is full of ridiculous yet clever humor that will crack up any sci-fi fan.</p>\n\n<h2>3. The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! (1988)</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/pTuFseQJmL8ZkJwSNQBv1iHk31b5mBbS1J95FwSC.jpg\" alt=\"5 Funniest Parody Movies That Will Makes You LOL\"/>\n\n<figcaption>5 Funniest Parody Movies That Will Makes You LOL © 2025 Trstdly.com</figcaption>\n\n<p>Starring Leslie Nielsen as the clueless yet determined detective Frank Drebin, The Naked Gun takes crime dramas and detective stories to ridiculous new heights.</p>\n\n<p>With slapstick humor, bizarre sight gags, and unexpected punchlines, the movie turns a simple police investigation into one of the funniest crime parodies ever made.</p>\n\n<p>Nielsen’s straight-faced delivery of the most absurd situations, like a disastrous baseball game and an outrageous car chase, ensures non-stop laughter.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Scary Movie (2000)</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/JSsu8ryUPEXf7o1eutbBMC4aOzk8mkaBWBudPPkB.jpg\" alt=\"5 Funniest Parody Movies That Will Makes You LOL\"/>\n\n<figcaption>5 Funniest Parody Movies That Will Makes You LOL © 2025 Trstdly.com</figcaption>\n\n<p>A parody of Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, and other horror films, Scary Movie is an outrageous take on the slasher genre.</p>\n\n<p>The film follows a group of clueless teenagers as they try to survive a masked killer while making fun of every horror cliché imaginable.</p>\n\n<p>With crude jokes, ridiculous references, and over-the-top slapstick, it’s a wild ride that doesn’t take itself seriously at all.</p>\n\n<p>The iconic \"Wazzup!\" scene alone is enough to make you laugh out loud.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Shaun of the Dead (2004)</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/BzcUqqYMZasc70EgvsiJuGF4ITMdnrmpOqlntDob.jpg\" alt=\"5 Funniest Parody Movies That Will Makes You LOL\"/>\n\n<figcaption>5 Funniest Parody Movies That Will Makes You LOL © 2025 Trstdly.com</figcaption>\n\n<p>Unlike traditional parodies that rely on constant jokes, Shaun of the Dead is a clever mix of zombie horror and British comedy.</p>\n\n<p>Edgar Wright’s masterpiece takes the classic zombie apocalypse setup and infuses it with witty dialogue, hilarious characters, and absurd situations.</p>\n\n<p>Watching an oblivious Shaun go about his daily routine while zombies invade his town is comedy gold.</p>\n\n<p>The movie also has heart, making it not just a parody but also a genuinely great zombie film.</p>"

The complex will have 30 bedrooms and 30 bathrooms spread over over a dozen structures.<br><br>According to documents received by the publication, the Facebook founder invested USD 170 million to buy land in Kauai, Hawaii, in August 2014.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/E7mK5FSx0QaaTLswwuAXQdPGHe4i9KBERpo90kSM.jpg\" alt=\"It is estimated that he has spent USD 100 million on development costs for the area.\"/>\n\n<figcaption>It is estimated that he has spent USD 100 million on development costs for the area. © 2023 trstdly.com</figcaption>\n\n<h2>It is estimated that he has spent USD 100 million on development costs for the area.</h2>\n\n<p>Mark Zuckerberg's sprawling complex is reportedly called Koolau Ranch.

Bad breath affects many adults around the world and can make social situations uncomfortable. This common problem happens when bacteria grow in your mouth and create unpleasant smells.</p>\n\n<p>Most people experience bad breath at some point in their lives. The good news is that you can solve this problem with simple steps and natural methods. Bad breath is not something you need to accept or feel embarrassed about.</p>\n\n<p>In this article, we will share some tips on how to get rid of bad breath at home. We will also talk about some causes of bad breath and how to avoid this problem. We gathered the information from various sources, Thursday (3/7/2025).</p>\n\n<h2>How to Get Rid of Bad Breath</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/WQsVW5asfoSmzT51fNE2iTVAK7rYPpFti0ZOihfQ.jpg\" alt=\"How to Get Rid of Bad Breath: 6 Tips and Foods to Eat\"/>\n\n<figcaption>How to get rid of bad breath at home. (Image by karlyukav on Freepik)</figcaption>\n\n<p>These proven methods can help you eliminate bad breath and feel more confident in social situations. Each technique targets different causes of mouth odors and works to create a cleaner, fresher environment in your mouth.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Brush Your Teeth Twice Daily With Fluoride Toothpaste: </strong>Clean your teeth for at least two minutes each time you brush. Make sure to reach all areas of your mouth, including the back teeth where food often gets stuck. Use gentle circular motions to remove bacteria and food particles effectively.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Clean Your Tongue Every Day: </strong>Use a tongue scraper or your toothbrush to remove the thin layer of bacteria that builds up on your tongue. The tongue holds about 85% of the bacteria that cause bad breath, so this step is very important for fresh breath.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Floss Between Your Teeth Daily:</strong> Remove food particles and bacteria from between your teeth where your toothbrush cannot reach. Floss at least once per day, preferably before bedtime, to prevent bacteria from growing overnight.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Use An Antibacterial Mouthwash: </strong>Rinse with mouthwash that kills bacteria and neutralizes odors. Choose alcohol-free options to avoid drying out your mouth, which can actually make bad breath worse.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Stay Hydrated Throughout The Day:</strong> Drink plenty of water to keep your mouth moist and wash away food particles. Aim for eight glasses of water daily to maintain good saliva production and prevent dry mouth.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Visit Your Dentist Regularly: </strong>Schedule dental checkups every six months to catch and treat problems early. Professional cleanings remove tartar and plaque that regular brushing cannot eliminate completely.</p>\n\n<h2>Causes of Bad Breath</h2>\n\n<p>Many different factors can cause bad breath and affect your daily life. These common causes contribute to unpleasant mouth odors and affect millions of people worldwide.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Poor Oral Hygiene Habits:</strong> Bacteria multiply quickly when you do not brush and floss regularly. Food particles remain in your mouth and begin to rot, creating strong odors that affect your breath throughout the day.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Dry Mouth Conditions: </strong>Your mouth produces less saliva when you sleep, take certain medications, or breathe through your mouth. Without enough saliva to wash away bacteria, your mouth becomes a perfect place for odor-causing germs to grow.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Gum Disease And Tooth Problems:</strong> Infections in your gums or teeth create pockets where bacteria can hide and multiply. These dental problems often cause persistent bad breath that does not go away with regular brushing alone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Medical Conditions: </strong>Diabetes, kidney problems, liver disease, and respiratory infections can cause bad breath. These conditions change how your body processes food and creates different chemical compounds that affect your breath.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Tobacco Use: </strong>Cigarettes, cigars, and other tobacco products dry out your mouth and leave strong odors. Tobacco also increases your risk of gum disease, which creates additional breath problems.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Bacteria On The Tongue: </strong>Most bad breath bacteria live on your tongue, especially at the back. These bacteria interact with amino acids from food and create smelly sulfur compounds that cause persistent odors.</p>\n\n<p>7<strong>. Digestive Disorders: </strong>Acid reflux, irritable bowel syndrome, and other stomach problems can cause bad breath. These conditions allow stomach acid or gases to reach your mouth and create unpleasant odors.</p>\n\n<h2>Foods That Can Cause Bad Breath</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/2VIiPlU6YWy6qhlJfzp8D0DSwMJqxfaZR0kUlvYW.jpg\" alt=\"How to Get Rid of Bad Breath: 6 Tips and Foods to Eat\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Foods that can cause bad breath. (Image by KamranAydinov on Freepik)</figcaption>\n\n<p>Certain foods create lasting odors that can affect your breath for hours or even days. These foods contain compounds that enter your bloodstream and return through your lungs when you breathe.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Garlic And Onions: </strong>These vegetables contain sulfur compounds that absorb into your bloodstream and come out through your lungs. The smell can last for days because the compounds circulate throughout your entire body.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Dairy Products: </strong>Milk and cheese contain amino acids that feed bacteria in your mouth. These bacteria produce foul-smelling compounds that create unpleasant breath odors, especially in people who are sensitive to dairy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Canned Fish And Seafood:</strong> Fish begins to oxidize and smell stronger when stored in metal cans. This process creates compounds that stick to your mouth and teeth, causing lasting breath problems.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Coffee And Tea: </strong>These popular drinks dry out your mouth and reduce saliva production. They also have strong smells that linger in your mouth long after you finish drinking them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Alcoholic Beverages: </strong>Alcohol dehydrates your mouth and creates an environment where bad bacteria can grow easily. Drinks high in sulfites cause particularly strong breath odors.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. High-Protein Foods: </strong>When your body uses protein for energy, it creates ketones that have a strong, unpleasant smell. This process happens more often when you eat large amounts of protein or follow certain diets.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7. Horseradish: </strong>This root vegetable contains isothiocynate compounds that give it a strong flavor and smell. These same compounds create lasting breath odors that can be difficult to eliminate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>8. Sugar And Sugary Foods: </strong>Sugar feeds the harmful bacteria in your mouth and helps them multiply quickly. These bacteria produce acid and foul-smelling compounds that contribute to bad breath and tooth decay.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9. Acidic Foods:</strong> Foods like tomatoes, citrus fruits, and sauerkraut create an acidic environment where harmful bacteria can thrive. This acidity can also weaken tooth enamel and worsen breath problems.</p>\n\n<h2>Foods to Fight Bad Breath</h2>\n\n<p>These natural foods help neutralize odors and create a cleaner mouth environment. Include these items in your daily diet to support fresh breath and better oral health.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Fresh Apples: </strong>Apples contain natural compounds that break down sulfur compounds in your bloodstream. They also stimulate saliva production and help scrub away bacteria as you chew them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Plain Yogurt: </strong>Yogurt with live bacteria cultures helps balance the good and bad bacteria in your mouth. Studies show that eating yogurt daily can reduce hydrogen sulfide, which smells like rotten eggs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Fresh Herbs Like Parsley And Mint: </strong>These herbs contain chlorophyll and essential oils that naturally freshen breath. Chew fresh leaves after meals or make tea with them for temporary odor relief.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Citrus Fruits: </strong>Oranges, lemons, and grapefruits stimulate saliva production with their high vitamin C content. More saliva means better natural cleaning of your mouth and fresher breath.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Green Tea: </strong>Green tea contains antibacterial compounds that fight odor-causing bacteria. It also has antioxidants that support overall oral health and reduce inflammation in your gums.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Crunchy Vegetables: </strong>Carrots, celery, and other fibrous vegetables act like natural toothbrushes. They scrub away plaque and bacteria while stimulating saliva flow to keep your mouth clean.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7. Fresh Pineapple: </strong>Many people believe pineapple juice helps eliminate bad breath quickly. Fresh pineapple contains enzymes that may break down odor-causing compounds in your mouth.</p>\n\n<p><strong>8. Milk:</strong> Milk can help neutralize strong odors from garlic and onions. The proteins in milk bind to the sulfur compounds and reduce their impact on your breath.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9. Fennel And Anise Seeds: </strong>These seeds have been used for centuries to freshen breath naturally. They contain sweet essential oils that mask odors and have antibacterial properties.</p>\n\n<p><strong>10. Cherries: </strong>Cherries contain compounds that specifically fight methyl mercaptan, which creates a rotten cabbage smell. They also provide vitamin C and fiber for overall oral health.</p>\n\n<p><strong>11. Water: </strong>Plain water is one of the best natural remedies for bad breath. It washes away food particles, bacteria, and odorous compounds while keeping your mouth properly hydrated.</p>\n\n<p><strong>12. Ginger: </strong>Fresh ginger contains 6-gingerol, which activates enzymes in saliva that break down sulfur compounds. Chew a small piece of fresh ginger for quick breath relief.</p>\n\n<h2>How to Prevent Bad Breath</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/Zhkilj4JY6Sj5k8JO1HvUnQeVcV5PL0svNXkTr2n.jpg\" alt=\"How to Get Rid of Bad Breath: 6 Tips and Foods to Eat\"/>\n\n<figcaption>How to prevent bad breath. (Image by Drazen Zigic on Freepik)</figcaption>\n\n<p>Prevention is the best approach to maintaining fresh breath every day. These simple habits help you avoid breath problems before they start and maintain good oral health.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Maintain Excellent Oral Hygiene: </strong>Brush your teeth twice daily, floss once daily, and clean your tongue regularly. Replace your toothbrush every three months or after you have been sick.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Eat Regular, Balanced Meals: </strong>Skip crash diets and extreme eating patterns that can cause ketosis and bad breath. Choose foods that require chewing to stimulate saliva production naturally.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Avoid Tobacco Products Completely: </strong>Stop smoking and use of other tobacco products to improve your breath and overall health. Ask your doctor for help with quitting if you need support.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Limit Foods That Cause Strong Odors: </strong>Reduce your intake of garlic, onions, and other foods that create lasting breath problems. When you do eat these foods, follow them with breath-freshening options like apples or herbs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Keep Your Mouth Moist: </strong>Drink water throughout the day and chew sugar-free gum to stimulate saliva production. Consider using a humidifier at night if you breathe through your mouth while sleeping.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Address Underlying Health Issues: </strong>Work with your doctor to manage medical conditions that contribute to bad breath. Take medications as prescribed and discuss breath concerns with your healthcare team.</p>"

Many people think about buying an electric car, but they worry about charging time. Tesla cars are very popular electric vehicles, and understanding their charging process can help you make better decisions about electric car ownership.</p>\n\n<p>Electric cars like Tesla are becoming more common on roads around the world. People choose them because they are better for the environment and cost less money to operate than gas cars. However, new electric car owners often feel confused about charging their vehicles and how much time it takes.</p>\n\n<p>In this article, we will explain everything you need to know about how long to charge a Tesla. We will look at different charging methods, actual charging times, and helpful tips to keep your Tesla battery healthy for many years. We gathered the information from various sources, Sunday (22/6/2025).</p>\n\n<h2>3 Ways to Charge a Tesla</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/PF1MuBiYAXdDoACSkTJ6ezknJ7kQBdadWU6ITEas.jpg\" alt=\"How Long to Charge a Tesla Car at Home and Supercharger\"/>\n\n<figcaption>3 ways to charge a Tesla car. (Photo by Vlad Tchompalov on Unsplash)</figcaption>\n\n<p>Tesla owners have several options for charging their electric vehicles. Each method works differently and offers various charging speeds depending on your needs and location.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Wall Connector - Best for Home Charging</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Wall Connector is Tesla's recommended solution for home charging. This device connects to a 240-volt outlet in your home and provides the fastest charging speed for daily use. Many Tesla owners install this charger in their garage because it works well for overnight charging. You can order a Wall Connector from Tesla and have a certified installer set it up at your home.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Mobile Connector - Perfect for Portable Charging</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Mobile Connector comes with every Tesla vehicle and works as a portable charging solution. This charger can plug into different types of outlets depending on your needs. You can use it with a standard 120-volt household outlet or connect it to a 240-volt outlet for faster charging. The Mobile Connector is perfect for emergency charging or when you visit places without dedicated Tesla chargers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Tesla Superchargers - Fastest Charging Option</strong></p>\n\n<p>Tesla Superchargers are special charging stations built by Tesla that offer the fastest charging speeds available. Superchargers use very high power to charge Tesla vehicles quickly and are designed for road trips and long-distance travel. Tesla has built over 60,000 Superchargers around the world, and they are usually located near highways, shopping centers, and hotels. Superchargers work 24 hours a day and are perfect for long trips.</p>\n\n<p>Many hotels, restaurants, and other destinations also offer charging facilities for electric cars. These destination chargers are actually the same technology as Wall Connectors but are installed at public locations. Destination charging works well when you plan to stay somewhere for several hours, like during a meal or overnight stay. These chargers provide the same charging experience as a home Wall Connector.</p>\n\n<h2>How Long to Charge a Tesla</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/z68bJqOp5m4MNoLPjxtrAALLUtQJ8GbX7STbL0r8.jpg\" alt=\"How Long to Charge a Tesla Car at Home and Supercharger\"/>\n\n<figcaption>How long do you need to charge a Tesla car? (Photo by Kindel Media on Pexels)</figcaption>\n\n<p>The time needed to charge your Tesla depends on which charging method you choose and how empty your battery is when you start charging.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Wall Connector at Home</strong></p>\n\n<p>A Wall Connector can add up to 44 miles of driving range per hour of charging. This makes it the fastest option for home charging and perfect for overnight use.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Mobile Connector with 120-Volt Outlet</strong></p>\n\n<p>Using a standard household outlet, the Mobile Connector adds only 2 to 3 miles of range per hour of charging. This is very slow and works best for emergency situations only.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Mobile Connector with 240-Volt Outlet</strong></p>\n\n<p>When connected to a 240-volt outlet, the Mobile Connector can add up to 30 miles of range per hour of charging. This speed is much better than standard outlets but still slower than a dedicated Wall Connector.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Tesla Superchargers</strong></p>\n\n<p>Superchargers provide the fastest charging experience, adding up to 200 miles of driving range in just 15 minutes. Most Tesla vehicles can charge from 10% to 80% battery capacity in 15 to 30 minutes at these stations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Destination Charging</strong></p>\n\n<p>Destination chargers work the same as Wall Connectors, adding up to 44 miles of range per hour of charging. These are perfect for longer stops at hotels, restaurants, or shopping centers.</p>\n\n<p>Several factors can affect these charging times and speeds. Cold weather can slow down charging because the battery needs to warm up first. Hot weather can also reduce charging speed as the cooling system works to keep the battery at the right temperature. Additionally, if many people are using the same Supercharger station, each charger might work slightly slower to share the available power.</p>\n\n<p>Different Tesla models and battery sizes also impact the time you need to charge a Tesla. For complete charging times, smaller Tesla models like the Model 3 typically need 5 to 6 hours with a Wall Connector, while larger models like the Model S and Model X require 8 to 9 hours for a full charge. Using a 120-volt outlet takes 30 to 50 hours for any Tesla model, making it impractical for daily use. Most Tesla owners prefer charging overnight at home or using Superchargers for quick stops during long trips.</p>\n\n<h2>Tips to Keep Your Electric Car Battery Healthy</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/VNprOGR2sB6eyPqbD81tVMhzorrQ0dfL2aELCkiM.jpg\" alt=\"How Long to Charge a Tesla Car at Home and Supercharger\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Tips to keep your electric car's battery healthy. (Photo by go-e on Unsplash)</figcaption>\n\n<p>Taking good care of your Tesla battery helps it last longer and charge more efficiently. Here are important tips that every Tesla owner should follow to maintain their battery health.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Keep Your Battery Between 20% and 80%</strong></p>\n\n<p>Avoid letting your Tesla battery go below 20% or charging it above 80% for daily use. This charging range puts less stress on the battery cells and helps them last longer. Tesla vehicles have settings that let you limit the maximum charge to 80%, making this tip easy to follow.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Avoid Charging to 100% Every Day</strong></p>\n\n<p>Only charge your Tesla to 100% when you need the extra range for long trips. Charging to full capacity every day can make your battery wear out faster. Save the 100% charge for special occasions when you really need the maximum driving range.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Use Superchargers Only When Necessary</strong></p>\n\n<p>While Superchargers are very convenient, using them too often can stress your battery. Try to use home charging or destination charging for most of your needs, and save Superchargers for road trips or emergencies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Park in Cool Places</strong></p>\n\n<p>Hot temperatures can damage your Tesla battery over time. Park your car in shaded areas or garages when possible, especially during summer months. Avoid leaving your Tesla in direct sunlight for many hours.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Let Your Car Cool Down Before Charging</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you just finished a long drive, wait a few minutes before plugging in your charger. Charging a hot battery can reduce its lifespan. Tesla vehicles have cooling systems, but giving them time to work is helpful.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Keep Your Tesla Active</strong></p>\n\n<p>Don't let your Tesla sit unused for many weeks. Take short drives regularly to keep the battery healthy. If you must store your car for a long time, keep the battery charge between 25% and 75%.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7. Use Scheduled Charging</strong></p>\n\n<p>Tesla vehicles allow you to set charging schedules through the car's screen or mobile app. This feature helps you charge during cooler nighttime hours and can save money if your electricity company offers lower rates at certain times.</p>"

However, the question that often arises is whether shaving the baby's hair can really make it grow thicker?</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/yZTjq4QjaqPcitHwE9jWsDS9Cv5F8njVGA2u9Uod.jpg\" alt=\"Does Shaving Baby's Hair Help in Growing Thicker Hair?\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Rewrite the following article into easily understandable English for readers.<br><br>Original Article:</figcaption>\n\n<span></span>\n\nAccording to Perdoski's website, newborn babies typically have very thin hair, and some may even appear bald. However, there are also babies who are born with thick hair. It is important to understand that the condition of a newborn baby's hair is not permanent and cannot be used as a reference for their hair when they grow up.\n\n<br><br>\n\nThe hair of a newborn baby is called velus hair. This type of hair has a very fine texture, thin strands, and a soft color. The growth of hair in babies begins when they reach 5-6 months in the womb.\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/IxxUxL4JmxF1lDbtBO8eb8k2AbfUnFa4UMlNLtfd.jpg\" alt=\"Does Shaving Baby's Hair Help in Growing Thicker Hair?\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Rewrite the following article into an easily understandable English for readers.<br><br>Original Article:<br>Peningkatan kepadatan penduduk di kota-kota besar telah menyebabkan berbagai masalah, termasuk kemacetan lalu lintas, polusi udara, dan tekanan pada infrastruktur.

This process will continue until the baby is around 1 year old.</p>\n\n<span></span>\n\nWhen a baby reaches the age of 1 year, their hair structure will change. The hair will feel rougher and thicker, and the hair pigment will start to show, following the hair color of the parents. The hair of children over 1 year old is called terminal hair.\n\n<br><br>\n\nIt is important to remember that the growth and characteristics of a baby's hair are also influenced by genetic factors. Hair color, hair follicle shape, and hair strand thickness are likely to not be far different from their parents or grandparents.\n\n<h2>Myths about Shaving Baby's Hair</h2>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p>Often, parents shave their baby's hair in the hope that this action will make the baby's hair grow thicker and more beautiful in the future. However, it is important to remember that the number of hair follicles in a baby is determined at birth and will not change as the baby grows up.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/gbRhnUTg2qK531wPCjspI5ta5OwB10YaNqY3lG4D.jpg\" alt=\"Myths about Shaving Baby's Hair\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Rewrite the following article into easily understandable English for readers.</figcaption>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p>In other words, shaving a baby's hair will not affect the number of hair follicles.

One of them is that it makes it easier to identify irritations, boils, or other skin problems on the baby's scalp.</p>\n\n<span></span>\n\nWith minimal hair, the problem can be easily detected and treated. In addition, babies tend to sweat more on their heads. By shaving their hair, the air circulation on the baby's scalp can improve, making them more comfortable.\n\n<br><br>\n\nSome parents may use hair lotion on their babies in hopes of increasing hair thickness. However, it should be noted that the use of hair lotion will not affect the number of existing hair follicles.\n\n<span></span>\n\nHair lotion is typically used to nourish the hair roots and make the hair appear thicker. It is best to use it in moderation to avoid causing irritation to the baby's scalp.\n\n<br><br>\n\nShaving a baby's hair is a long-standing tradition in many communities.

In this article, we will discuss some helpful tips for effective time management.<br><br>1. Set Clear Goals:<br>One of the most important aspects of time management is setting clear goals. Without clear goals, it can be difficult to prioritize tasks and allocate your time effectively. Take some time to identify your short-term and long-term goals, and break them down into smaller, manageable tasks.<br><br>2. Prioritize Tasks:<br>Once you have set your goals, it is essential to prioritize your tasks. Determine which tasks are urgent and important and focus on completing those first. Use tools like to-do lists or task management apps to help you stay organized and prioritize your tasks effectively.<br><br>3. Avoid Procrastination:<br>Procrastination is a common time management challenge. It can lead to wasted time and increased stress. To avoid procrastination, try breaking your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. Set specific deadlines for each task and hold yourself accountable. Additionally, eliminate distractions and create a conducive work environment to stay focused.<br><br>4. Delegate and Outsource:<br>It is important to recognize that you cannot do everything on your own. Learn to delegate tasks to others who are capable and willing to help. Delegating not only lightens your workload but also allows you to focus on more critical tasks. If possible, consider outsourcing tasks that are not within your expertise, saving you time and effort.<br><br>5. Learn to Say No:<br>Saying yes to every request can lead to overcommitment and a lack of time for your own priorities. Learn to say no politely when necessary. Understand that you cannot please everyone and that it is okay to prioritize your own needs and goals.<br><br>6. Take Breaks and Rest:<br>While it may seem counterintuitive, taking breaks and allowing yourself to rest is essential for effective time management. Taking short breaks can help you recharge and maintain focus. Additionally, ensure you get enough sleep at night to avoid fatigue and improve your productivity during the day.<br><br>Conclusion:<br>Effective time management is a skill that can be learned and developed with practice. By setting clear goals, prioritizing tasks, avoiding procrastination, delegating when necessary, learning to say no, and taking breaks, you can improve your time management skills and achieve greater productivity and work-life balance.</figcaption>\n\n<h2>The growth of baby hair is mostly determined by genetic factors and its natural development over time.</h2>"

Their unique shape and bright colors make them an intriguing addition to any fruit bowl. However, despite their captivating exterior, many people are unsure about how to cut a dragon fruit and enjoy its deliciousness. Fear not, as we will guide you through the process step by step.</p>\n\n<span></span>\n\nDragon fruits come in different varieties, but the most common ones have a red or yellow outer skin with green scales. Contrary to what one might assume, these scales are not hard or sharp but rather soft and edible. Once the fruit is opened, you will discover a white or pink flesh speckled with tiny edible seeds.\n\n<br><br>\n\nKnowing how to cut a dragon fruit not only ensures that you can enjoy this tropical delight but also avoids any potential mishaps or wastes. Handling this fruit properly can prevent injuries and ensure that you make the most of its juicy, mildly sweet flavor.\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/RgK0vM1gQgjQQbqsrG0SnIClUdOMfK0SA4NFZtnn.jpg\" alt=\"How To Cut A Dragon Fruit And How To Store It Properly\"/>\n\n<figcaption>How to cut a dragon fruit properly.

We gathered this guide from various sources, Friday (1/3/2024).</p>\n\n<p>Dragon fruits, with their vibrant colors and exotic appearance, are a delicious tropical treat enjoyed by many. However, selecting the ripest fruit is key to experiencing its full flavor and sweetness. Follow these simple steps to choose the perfect dragon fruit:</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/2hq8x9XvYYSdzat81NvZJF1SkCmxNb7WO5hmfOr7.jpg\" alt=\"<b>A. How To Pick Ripe Dragon Fruits</b>\"/>\n\n<figcaption>How to pick a ripe dragon fruit. (Photo by Any Lane on Pexels)</figcaption>\n\n<h2><b>A. How To Pick Ripe Dragon Fruits</b></h2>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<b>1. Check the Color: </b>\n\nRipe dragon fruits come in various shades, depending on the variety. Look for vibrant, evenly colored fruits without any signs of bruising or discoloration. While most dragon fruits have pink or yellow skin, some varieties may appear red or purple when ripe.\n\n<br><br>\n\n<b>2. Check the Texture: </b>\n\nGently press the skin of the fruit with your fingers. Ripe dragon fruits should give slightly under pressure, similar to a ripe avocado. Avoid fruits that feel too hard or overly soft, as they may be underripe or overripe, respectively.\n\n<h2><b>3. Check the Firmness</b></h2>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p>A ripe dragon fruit should feel firm but not rock-hard. Press your fingers against the skin and make sure it yields slightly without feeling mushy. If the fruit feels too firm, it may need more time to ripen. Conversely, if it feels too soft, it may be overripe and past its prime.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/VRcsad7vssm8hxEbb00ehVak6qbV3lvh2kjMbwVF.jpg\" alt=\"<b>3. Check the Firmness</b>\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Tips to pick a ripe dragon fruits. (Photo by Lovefood Art on Pexels)</figcaption>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<b>4. Avoid Blemishes:</b>\n\nInspect the surface of the fruit for any blemishes, mold, or soft spots. These are signs of decay or damage and should be avoided. A healthy dragon fruit should have smooth, unblemished skin, free from any signs of decay.\n\n<br><br>\n\n<b>5. Follow Your Nose: </b>\n\nTry to sniff the smell of the fruit near the stem end. Ripe dragon fruits often emit a subtle, sweet fragrance similar to a blend of floral and tropical notes. If the fruit smells pleasant and fragrant, it's likely ripe and ready to eat.\n\n<h2><b>B. How To Cut A Dragon Fruit</b></h2>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p>Once you've selected the perfect ripe dragon fruit, it's time to unlock its delicious flavor and juicy goodness by cutting it the right way. Follow these simple steps to slice into your dragon fruit with ease:</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/KEPEmFuHhdM9EeXY8K3KKr5IF0CEO9Ai5JB26zVT.jpg\" alt=\"<b>B. How To Cut A Dragon Fruit</b>\"/>\n\n<figcaption>How to cut a dragon fruit. (Image by wirestock on Freepik)</figcaption>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p><b>1. Wash the Fruit:</b> Start by rinsing the dragon fruit under cool running water to remove any dirt or debris from the skin. Use your hands to gently rub the surface of the fruit to ensure it's clean.<br><br><b>2. Slice off the Ends:</b> Place the dragon fruit on the cutting board horizontally. Use your knife to slice off both ends of the fruit. This will create stable, flat surfaces to work with and make it easier to peel the skin off.<br></p>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<b>3. Peel the Skin: </b>\n\nStand the dragon fruit upright on one of the flat ends. Hold it steady with one hand while using the other hand to carefully slice downward, following the curve of the fruit to remove the skin. Repeat this process around the entire fruit until all the skin has been removed.\n\n<br><br>\n\n<b>4. Cutting into Wedges: </b>\n\nOnce the skin is removed, cut the fruit vertically into halves. Lay each half flat on the cutting board, then slice each half into triangular wedges by making diagonal cuts from top to bottom.\n\n<br>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p><b>5. Cutting into Cubes: </b>Start by cutting the peeled dragon fruit into slices, about 1/2 to 1 inch thick. Stack the slices on top of each other, then cut them into strips. Rotate the stack of strips and cut across them to create cubes.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/G100mK2cymCv3IZn1rZ4mYF4woDxaSKoDPTg8a5j.jpg\" alt=\"How To Cut A Dragon Fruit And How To Store It Properly\"/>\n\n<figcaption></figcaption>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p><b>6. Cutting into Rounds:</b> Begin by cutting the peeled dragon fruit into slices, about 1/2 to 1 inch thick, horizontally across the fruit. Lay each slice flat on the cutting board to create round discs. <br><br><b>7. Serve and Enjoy:</b> Your freshly cut dragon fruit is now ready to be enjoyed! You can eat it on its own as a refreshing snack, add it to fruit salads or smoothie bowls, or incorporate it into various recipes for a tropical twist.<br></p>\n\n<p>Now that you've learned how to pick ripe dragon fruits and cut them with ease, it's important to know how to store them properly to maintain their freshness and flavor. Follow these simple guidelines to store both peeled and unpeeled dragon fruits:</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/DiuQOmijG91sgk8u8u94RYyvERIBAkjqQEhdzrr6.jpg\" alt=\"<b>C. How To Store Dragon Fruits Properly</b>\"/>\n\n<figcaption>How to store a dragon fruit properly. (Image by Freepik)</figcaption>\n\n<h2><b>C. How To Store Dragon Fruits Properly</b></h2>\n\n<h2><b>1. Unpeeled Dragon Fruits:</b></h2>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<ul><li>If you have unpeeled dragon fruits, store them at room temperature in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.</li></ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<ul><li>Avoid storing them in the refrigerator unless they're fully ripe and you want to prolong their shelf life. Refrigeration can cause unripe dragon fruits to become mushy and lose their flavor.</li></ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<ul><li>Unpeeled dragon fruits can last for up to 5-7 days at room temperature, depending on their ripeness when purchased.</li></ul>\n\n<h2><b>2. Peeled Dragon Fruits:</b></h2>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<ul><li>If you've already peeled your dragon fruit, it's best to store the leftover flesh in an airtight container in the refrigerator.</li></ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<ul><li>Place the peeled dragon fruit in a container or wrap it tightly with plastic wrap to prevent exposure to air, which can cause it to oxidize and lose its freshness.</li></ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<ul><li>Peeled dragon fruit should be consumed within 2-3 days to ensure the best flavor and texture.</li></ul>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<b>3. Avoid Freezing:</b>\n\nWhile you can technically freeze dragon fruit for longer-term storage, the texture may become mushy when thawed, affecting its overall quality. It's best to enjoy dragon fruit fresh or refrigerated for the best taste and texture.\n\n<br><br>\n\nBy following these storage tips, you can enjoy your dragon fruits at their peak freshness and flavor. Whether you choose to store them unpeeled at room temperature or peeled in the refrigerator, proper storage will help prolong their shelf life and prevent unnecessary waste."

Use fresh tortillas: </b>\n\nStart with good-quality corn tortillas. Cut them into triangles and fry them until crispy. You can also use store-bought tortilla chips, but homemade ones taste better.\n\n<br><br>\n\n<b>2. Make your own sauce: </b>\n\nThe sauce is very important in a chilaquiles recipe. Try to make it from scratch using fresh ingredients. This will give your dish more flavor.\n\n<br><br>\n\n<b>3. Don't let the chips get too soggy:</b>\n\nWhen you add the sauce to the chips, do it quickly and serve right away. This way, the chips will stay a bit crispy.\n\n<br>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p><b>4. Add toppings:</b> Chilaquiles are great with lots of toppings. Try adding cheese, cream, onions, and cilantro. You can also add eggs, chicken, or beans to make it more filling.<br><br><b>5. Adjust the spice level:</b> If you like spicy food, add more chili to your sauce. If you don't like spicy food, use less chili or choose mild peppers.<br><br><b>6. Serve hot:</b> Chilaquiles taste best when they're hot and fresh. Serve them right after you make them for the best taste.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/agacVCP0FhpmEEvt4P0P8FvKlcGE22uKO2Tl7jyc.jpg\" alt=\"Classic Red Chilaquiles Recipe\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Classic red chilaquiles recipe.

The smell of a well-seasoned steak cooking fills your kitchen and makes everyone excited for dinner.</p>\n\n<p>Sirloin steak comes from the back part of the cow and offers excellent flavor at a reasonable price. This cut of meat has less fat than ribeye but more taste than tenderloin, making it perfect for home cooking. A good sirloin steak recipe creates tender, juicy meat that satisfies meat lovers without breaking your budget.</p>\n\n<p>In this article, we will share four sirloin steak recipe ideas that you can try at home. From the classic pan seared sirloin steak to the flavorful grilled sirloin steak with chimichurri sauce, these recipes are perfect for dinner. We gathered these recipes from various sources, Tuesday (1/7/2025).</p>\n\n<h2>Pan Seared Sirloin Steak Recipe</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/ztp08xh3bYc1PKVDUhjd8G7SFJn8Pu8YwdcwSQvf.jpg\" alt=\"Sirloin Steak Recipe: 4 Tasty Ideas for Dinner\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Pan-seared sirloin steak recipe. (Photo by Nano Erdozain on Pexels)</figcaption>\n\n<p>Pan searing creates a beautiful golden crust while keeping the inside tender and juicy. This cooking method works well for any thickness of sirloin and gives you complete control over the cooking process.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>\n\n<p>- 4 sirloin steaks (6-8 oz each)</p>\n\n<p>- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil</p>\n\n<p>- 1 teaspoon salt</p>\n\n<p>- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper</p>\n\n<p>- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</p>\n\n<p>- 2 tablespoons butter</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n\n<p>1. Take the steaks out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking. This allows the meat to reach room temperature for even cooking throughout.</p>\n\n<p>2. Pat each steak completely dry with paper towels. Moisture on the surface prevents proper browning and creates steam instead of a nice crust.</p>\n\n<p>3. Season both sides of each steak generously with salt, black pepper, and garlic powder. Press the seasonings into the meat gently with your hands.</p>\n\n<p>4. Heat a large skillet or cast iron pan over medium-high heat. Add vegetable oil and let it get hot until it starts to shimmer.</p>\n\n<p>5. Carefully place the steaks in the hot pan. Do not move them for 3-4 minutes to allow a good crust to form on the bottom.</p>\n\n<p>6. Flip the steaks using tongs and cook for another 3-4 minutes for medium-rare doneness. Adjust cooking time based on your preferred level of doneness.</p>\n\n<p>7. Add butter to the pan during the last minute of cooking. Tilt the pan and spoon the melted butter over the steaks repeatedly.</p>\n\n<p>8. Remove steaks from heat and let them rest on a cutting board for 5 minutes before serving. </p>\n\n<h2>Grilled Sirloin Steak Recipe</h2>\n\n<p>Grilling adds smoky flavor and attractive grill marks that make your sirloin steak look and taste amazing. This outdoor cooking method is perfect for summer gatherings and family barbecues.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>\n\n<p>- 4 sirloin steaks (6-8 oz each)</p>\n\n<p>- 3 tablespoons olive oil</p>\n\n<p>- 2 teaspoons salt</p>\n\n<p>- 1 teaspoon black pepper</p>\n\n<p>- 1 teaspoon paprika</p>\n\n<p>- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n\n<p>1. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat, around 400-450 degrees Fahrenheit. Clean the grill grates thoroughly and oil them lightly to prevent sticking.</p>\n\n<p>2. Remove steaks from refrigerator and let them sit at room temperature for 20-30 minutes before grilling.</p>\n\n<p>3. Brush both sides of each steak with olive oil. This helps the seasonings stick and prevents the meat from sticking to the grill.</p>\n\n<p>4. Mix salt, black pepper, paprika, and onion powder in a small bowl. Sprinkle this seasoning mixture evenly on both sides of the steaks.</p>\n\n<p>5. Place steaks on the hottest part of the grill. Cook for 4-5 minutes without moving them to create nice grill marks.</p>\n\n<p>6. Rotate each steak 45 degrees and cook for another 2-3 minutes to create crosshatch grill marks.</p>\n\n<p>7. Flip the steaks and repeat the process on the other side. Total cooking time should be 8-10 minutes for medium-rare.</p>\n\n<p>8. Use a meat thermometer to check internal temperature. Remove steaks when they reach 130-135 degrees Fahrenheit for medium-rare.</p>\n\n<p>9. Transfer steaks to a platter and cover loosely with aluminum foil. Let them rest for 5-10 minutes before cutting and serving.</p>\n\n<h2>Sirloin Steak With Garlic Butter Recipe</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/MQuY5XgvSJGxv8KRmwsild8sxkJr3upA9mU4Kyvs.jpg\" alt=\"Sirloin Steak Recipe: 4 Tasty Ideas for Dinner\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Sirloin steak with garlic butter recipe. (Image by takedahrs from Pixabay)</figcaption>\n\n<p>Garlic butter transforms a simple sirloin steak into an elegant dinner that tastes like it came from an expensive restaurant. The rich, aromatic butter melts over the hot steak and creates incredible flavor.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>\n\n<p>- 4 sirloin steaks (6-8 oz each)</p>\n\n<p>- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil</p>\n\n<p>- 1 teaspoon salt</p>\n\n<p>- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper</p>\n\n<p>- 4 tablespoons butter (softened)</p>\n\n<p>- 4 cloves garlic (minced)</p>\n\n<p>- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley (chopped)</p>\n\n<p>- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n\n<p>1. Let steaks come to room temperature for 30 minutes. Season both sides generously with salt and black pepper.</p>\n\n<p>2. Make garlic butter by mixing softened butter, minced garlic, chopped parsley, and red pepper flakes in a small bowl. Set aside at room temperature.</p>\n\n<p>3. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until the oil begins to smoke slightly.</p>\n\n<p>4. Add steaks to the hot pan and cook without moving for 4 minutes. </p>\n\n<p>5. Flip steaks using tongs and cook for another 3-4 minutes. The exact time depends on thickness and desired doneness level.</p>\n\n<p>6. Reduce heat to medium-low and add half of the garlic butter mixture to the pan. Let it melt and bubble around the steaks.</p>\n\n<p>7. Tilt the pan and use a spoon to baste the steaks with the foaming garlic butter continuously for 1-2 minutes.</p>\n\n<p>8. Remove steaks from pan and place on serving plates. Top each steak with remaining garlic butter while the meat is still hot.</p>\n\n<p>9. Let steaks rest for 3-5 minutes to allow the garlic butter to soak in and the juices to settle before serving.</p>\n\n<h2>Grilled Sirloin Steak Recipe With Chimichurri</h2>\n\n<p>Chimichurri is a fresh, vibrant sauce from Argentina that transforms grilled sirloin steak into an extraordinary meal. This bright green sauce combines herbs, garlic, and vinegar to create a perfect complement to the smoky flavors of grilled beef.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>For the steaks:</strong></p>\n\n<p>- 4 sirloin steaks (6-8 oz each)</p>\n\n<p>- 2 tablespoons olive oil</p>\n\n<p>- 1 teaspoon salt</p>\n\n<p>- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper</p>\n\n<p><strong>For the chimichurri:</strong></p>\n\n<p>- 1 cup fresh parsley (chopped)</p>\n\n<p>- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro (chopped)</p>\n\n<p>- 3 cloves garlic (minced)</p>\n\n<p>- 1/4 cup olive oil</p>\n\n<p>- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</p>\n\n<p>- 1/2 teaspoon salt</p>\n\n<p>- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n\n<p>1. Make chimichurri sauce first by combining chopped parsley, cilantro, minced garlic, olive oil, red wine vinegar, salt, and red pepper flakes in a bowl. Mix well and let it sit for 30 minutes to develop flavors.</p>\n\n<p>2. Remove steaks from refrigerator and let them reach room temperature for 20-30 minutes before grilling.</p>\n\n<p>3. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat, approximately 400-450 degrees Fahrenheit. Clean grill grates and brush with oil to prevent sticking.</p>\n\n<p>4. Pat steaks dry with paper towels and brush both sides lightly with olive oil. Season generously with salt and black pepper.</p>\n\n<p>5. Place steaks on the grill over direct heat. Cook for 4-5 minutes on the first side without moving them to create good grill marks.</p>\n\n<p>6. Flip steaks using tongs and grill for another 4-5 minutes for medium-rare doneness. Adjust cooking time based on your preference and steak thickness.</p>\n\n<p>7. Check internal temperature with a meat thermometer. Remove steaks when they reach 130-135 degrees Fahrenheit for medium-rare.</p>\n\n<p>8. Transfer grilled steaks to a serving platter and let them rest for 5 minutes. This allows juices to redistribute throughout the meat.</p>\n\n<p>9. Spoon generous amounts of chimichurri sauce over each steak just before serving. Serve extra sauce on the side for guests who want more.</p>"

Scientific studies show that TNR effectively addresses the population of unowned cats by ending the breeding cycle, meaning no new kittens are born in the cat colony.<br><br>Through TNR, adult cats who have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, and ear-tipped are returned to their outdoor homes to live out their lives with their feline families. Many of these cats have dedicated caregivers who provide food and outdoor shelter with their own time and money.</p>"

They are loaded with zinc, a mineral vital for testosterone production and maintaining a healthy sperm count.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, oysters contain dopamine, a hormone that increases sexual desire. Their high protein content provides sustained energy, making them a luxurious and effective choice for enhancing performance.</p>\n\n<h2>Dark Chocolate</h2>\n\n<p>Dark chocolate, particularly varieties with a high cacao content, is a delightful way to enhance sexual stamina.</p>\n\n<p>It contains flavonoids, which improve blood circulation and promote the release of endorphins, enhancing mood and reducing stress. Dark chocolate also contains phenylethylamine, a compound linked to arousal and pleasure.</p>\n\n<p>Incorporating moderate amounts into your diet can create a positive and indulgent impact on sexual health.</p>\n\n<h2>Banana</h2>\n\n<p>Rich in potassium and vitamin B6, bananas are an excellent choice for enhancing energy and stamina.</p>\n\n<p>Potassium aids in maintaining optimal muscle function and blood flow, which are crucial during physical activity, including sex.</p>\n\n<p>The fruit is also a natural source of bromelain, an enzyme known to improve libido and testosterone production. Its quick energy boost makes it a convenient snack to enjoy before intimacy.</p>\n\n<h2>Watermelon</h2>\n\n<p>Watermelon is often referred to as a natural Viagra due to its high content of citrulline, an amino acid that relaxes blood vessels and improves circulation.</p>\n\n<p>This effect supports stronger and longer-lasting erections. It’s also rich in water, keeping the body hydrated and boosting overall energy levels.</p>\n\n<p>Watermelon is refreshing and easy to include in meals or enjoy as a snack.</p>\n\n<h2>Avocados</h2>\n\n<p>Packed with healthy monounsaturated fats, vitamin E, and potassium, avocados are a fantastic food for boosting stamina. Vitamin E improves blood circulation, while potassium supports heart health and muscle function.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, avocados are rich in folic acid, which helps metabolize proteins and provides a sustained energy boost, making them ideal for enhancing endurance and libido.</p>"

Changi Airport is often a transit airport for various airlines in Asia and the world.<br><br>In addition, Changi Airport was also built not merely as a cross-country passenger boarding and alighting but as an all-in-one package for travelers, shopping, amusement parks, rest, and dining.</p>\n\n<p>\"So the facilities that we have, the infrastructure that we have, and the fact that Singapore is very well connected to the rest of Southeast Asia by air, and even by sea and land, makes it easy for visitors from all over the region to come to the concert.

These problems might come from tonsil stones, which are small hard pieces that form in your mouth. Learning how to get tonsil stones out can help you feel better and have fresh breath again.</p>\n\n<p>Tonsil stones are more common than most people think. They can make your mouth smell bad and cause pain when you swallow. Many adults have these stones but do not know about them because they are very small.</p>\n\n<p>In this article, we will talk about how to get tonsil stones out at home. We will also talk about the causes, symptoms, and how to prevent it from coming back. We gathered the information from various sources, Tuesday (1/7/2025). </p>\n\n<h2>What Are Tonsil Stones?</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/oOcwhivih5l6L0xknQ2UUDLOFytTw5m6eC2rEdJD.jpg\" alt=\"How to Get Tonsil Stones Out: 6 Home Remedies to Try\"/>\n\n<figcaption>What are tonsil stones? (Image by wayhomestudio on Freepik)</figcaption>\n\n<p>Tonsil stones are small, hard lumps that form in your tonsils. They look like tiny white or yellow pieces of rice. The medical name for these stones is tonsilloliths. Your tonsils are two small areas of soft tissue at the back of your throat.</p>\n\n<p>These stones are made of different things that get stuck in your tonsils. They contain calcium, old food pieces, bacteria, and dead cells from your mouth. When these materials stay in your tonsils for a long time, they become hard like small rocks.</p>\n\n<p>Tonsil stones can be very small or grow to the size of a grape. Most stones are small and do not cause problems. However, larger stones can make you feel uncomfortable and cause bad breath. Some people have just one stone, while others may have several stones at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>The stones form in small pockets or holes in your tonsils called crypts. These crypts are normal parts of your tonsils, but some people have deeper crypts than others. People with deeper crypts are more likely to get tonsil stones because food and bacteria can get trapped more easily.</p>\n\n<h2>Causes of Tonsil Stones</h2>\n\n<p>Tonsil stones happen when materials get stuck in the small spaces of your tonsils. Several things can make this more likely to happen. Here are some causes of tonsil stones that you should know:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Poor Mouth Cleaning</strong></p>\n\n<p>Poor mouth cleaning is one of the main causes of tonsil stones. When you do not brush your teeth well or skip cleaning your mouth, bacteria and food pieces build up. These materials can then get trapped in your tonsils and form stones over time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Frequent Throat Infections</strong></p>\n\n<p>People who get throat infections often are more likely to have tonsil stones. When your tonsils get infected or swollen many times, the small pockets in them can become larger. Larger pockets can trap more food and bacteria, making it easier for stones to form.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Dry Mouth</strong></p>\n\n<p>Having a dry mouth also makes tonsil stones more likely. Saliva helps wash away food pieces and bacteria from your mouth. When your mouth is dry, these materials stay longer and can get trapped in your tonsils. Some medicines, breathing through your mouth, or not drinking enough water can cause dry mouth.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Large Tonsils with Deep Pockets</strong></p>\n\n<p>Large tonsils or tonsils with deep pockets are another cause. Some people are born with tonsils that have deeper spaces where materials can hide. These people may get tonsil stones more often than others, even if they take good care of their mouth.</p>\n\n<h2>Signs That You Are Having Tonsil Stones</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/KxNSa6gOcCAR7IBJfRY4g7uLPy1SGmRn5ij6MoOF.jpg\" alt=\"How to Get Tonsil Stones Out: 6 Home Remedies to Try\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Signs that you have tonsil stones. (Image by diana.grytsku on Freepik)</figcaption>\n\n<p>Many people have small tonsil stones but do not know about them. However, larger stones usually cause symptoms that you can notice. Here are some signs that you are having tonsil stones:</p>\n\n<p>- Bad breath</p>\n\n<p>- Feeling something stuck in your throat</p>\n\n<p>- Sore throat</p>\n\n<p>- Visible white or yellow spots on your tonsils</p>\n\n<p>- Ear pain</p>\n\n<p>- Cough that does not go away</p>\n\n<p>- Trouble swallowing</p>\n\n<h2>How to Get Tonsil Stones Out at Home</h2>\n\n<p>There are several safe ways to remove tonsil stones at home. These methods work best for small to medium-sized stones. Always be gentle when trying to remove stones to avoid hurting your throat.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Salt Water Gargle</strong></p>\n\n<p>Gargling with warm salt water is one of the easiest ways to get tonsil stones out. Mix half a teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm water. Gargle for 15 to 30 seconds, focusing on the back of your throat. The salt water helps loosen the stones and reduces bacteria. Repeat this 2 to 3 times a day until the stones come out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Coughing</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes a strong cough can push tonsil stones out naturally. Try to cough hard but do not force it too much. This method works best for loose stones that are ready to come out. Drink water before coughing to help loosen the stones first.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Cotton Swab Method</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you can see the tonsil stones clearly, you may be able to remove them with a clean cotton swab. Wash your hands first and use good lighting. Gently press the swab near the stone to push it out. Be very careful not to push too hard or go too deep, as this can cause bleeding or make you gag.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Water Flosser</strong></p>\n\n<p>A water flosser or water pick can help flush out tonsil stones. Point the water stream toward the stones and use low pressure at first. The water can push the stones out without you having to touch your throat. This method is safer than using cotton swabs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Apple Cider Vinegar Gargle</strong></p>\n\n<p>Mix one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar with a cup of warm water. Gargle with this mixture for 20 to 30 seconds. The acid in vinegar can help break down the stones over time. Rinse your mouth with plain water afterward to protect your teeth from the acid.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Manual Removal</strong></p>\n\n<p>As a last option, you can try to remove visible stones with clean fingers. Wash your hands well and only try this if the stone is easy to reach. Gently push near the stone to make it come out. Always rinse your mouth with salt water after manual removal to prevent infection.</p>\n\n<h2>How to Prevent Tonsil Stones</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/6ehOXYBNvcaHztIi7C7HN0nXThE8gYrT5H0azvbg.jpg\" alt=\"How to Get Tonsil Stones Out: 6 Home Remedies to Try\"/>\n\n<figcaption>How to prevent tonsil stones. (Image by Freepik)</figcaption>\n\n<p>Preventing tonsil stones is easier than removing them. Good mouth care and healthy habits can stop stones from forming in the first place. These prevention methods also help keep your mouth healthy overall.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Brush and Floss Daily</strong></p>\n\n<p>Clean your teeth at least twice a day with fluoride toothpaste. Also clean your tongue because bacteria can build up there too. Floss every day to remove food pieces between your teeth. Good mouth cleaning reduces the bacteria and food that can form stones.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Use Alcohol-Free Mouthwash</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rinse with mouthwash that does not contain alcohol. Alcohol can dry your mouth, which makes tonsil stones more likely. Look for mouthwash with ingredients like cetylpyridinium chloride or peroxide. Use mouthwash after brushing your teeth.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Drink Plenty of Water</strong></p>\n\n<p>Stay hydrated by drinking water throughout the day. Water helps wash away food pieces and bacteria from your mouth and throat. It also prevents dry mouth, which can lead to more bacteria growth. Aim to drink at least 8 glasses of water daily.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Gargle Regularly</strong></p>\n\n<p>Make gargling part of your daily routine. Use warm salt water or plain water to rinse your throat after meals. This helps remove food pieces before they can get trapped in your tonsils. Gargling also reduces bacteria in your throat.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Avoid Smoking and Limit Alcohol</strong></p>\n\n<p>Smoking and drinking too much alcohol can dry your mouth and increase bacteria. These habits also cause inflammation in your throat, which can make tonsil stones more likely. Quitting smoking and drinking less alcohol helps prevent many mouth and throat Problems.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Eat Healthy Foods</strong></p>\n\n<p>Choose foods that are good for your mouth health. Limit sugary foods and drinks because they feed bacteria. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, which help keep your mouth clean. Avoid sticky foods that can get stuck in your teeth and tonsils.</p>\n\n<p>Remember that tonsil stones are usually not dangerous, but they can be uncomfortable. If home methods do not work or if stones keep coming back, you should see a doctor. Large stones or frequent stone problems might need professional treatment. Taking good care of your mouth is the best way to prevent tonsil stones and keep your throat healthy.</p>"

From the sporting management and the coaching staff, we understood that we had to improve the second line of attack. Antony is already with us, but we must not individualise any player.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"For the team to achieve its objectives, both Antony and the rest of the players will have to take a step forward and demonstrate on a daily basis, from the maximum involvement and talent, to meet the objective one more year.\"</p>\n\n<p>As is known, during his career at Manchester United, Antony often had difficulty in developing his performance in the game.</p>\n\n<p>The 24-year-old player is even considered by football fans, especially Man United fans as a failed purchase because of the lack of positive impact he gave to the Red Devils squad at a price of 86 million euros.</p>\n\n<p>This also makes the player a frequent joke on the internet with many memes and mockery about him on the internet.</p>\n\n<h2>What's next fo Antony in Real Betis?</h2>\n\n<p>Launching from Goal, Real Betis believe the 24-year-old can have a significant impact. They currently sit ninth in La Liga, and are just two points behind sixth-placed Mallorca.</p>\n\n<p>For the record, finishing sixth will ensure they qualify for the Champions League.</p>\n\n<p>Real Betis will face Athletic Club on Sunday in La Liga and it's unclear if Antony will be in the squad.</p>\n\n<p>Do you think Antony will be at his best when he makes his Real Betis debut?</p>"

A Comprehensive Guide\"/>\n\n<h1>What is a Free Response Question? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>\n\n<p>Free response questions, also called FRQs or essay questions, are a type of test question where students must write their own answer. Unlike multiple-choice questions, there are no options to choose from. Students have to come up with the answer on their own and explain it in their own words.</p>\n\n<p>These questions test how well students can think critically, analyze information, and express their ideas clearly in writing. Free response questions are common in many school subjects, standardized tests, and even some job applications.</p>\n\n<p>The main features of free response questions are:</p>\n\n<p>•\tThey require written answers, not just selecting from choices</p>\n\n<p>•\tAnswers can be short (a few sentences) or long (full essays)</p>\n\n<p>•\tThere is usually no single “correct” answer</p>\n\n<p>•\tGrading looks at content, reasoning, and writing skills</p>\n\n<p>•\tThey test higher-level thinking and communication abilities</p>\n\n<p>Types of Free Response Questions</p>\n\n<p>There are several main types of free response questions:</p>\n\n<p>Short Answer Questions</p>\n\n<p>These questions need brief answers, usually a few sentences or a short paragraph. They test basic knowledge and understanding of a topic. For example: “Explain the water cycle in 2-3 sentences.”</p>\n\n<p>Essay Questions</p>\n\n<p>Essay questions require longer, more detailed answers. They test deeper understanding and ability to develop arguments. For example: “Discuss the causes and effects of climate change. Use specific examples in your answer.”</p>\n\n<p>Problem-Solving Questions</p>\n\n<p>These questions ask students to solve a problem and explain their process. Common in math and science. For example: “A ball is thrown upward with an initial velocity of 20 m/s. Calculate how high it will go and show your work.”</p>\n\n<p>Document-Based Questions (DBQs)</p>\n\n<p>Students analyze given documents or sources to answer a question. Often used in history exams. For example: “Using the provided primary sources, explain the main causes of World War I.”</p>\n\n<p>Data Analysis Questions</p>\n\n<p>These questions ask students to interpret data, like graphs or statistics, and draw conclusions. For example: “Analyze the trends shown in this graph of global temperatures over the past century.”</p>\n\n<p>Common Formats for Free Response Questions</p>\n\n<p>Free response questions can be presented in different formats:</p>\n\n<p>Open-Ended Questions</p>\n\n<p>These are broad questions with no set structure for the answer. Students have freedom in how they respond. For example: “What do you think are the biggest challenges facing our society today?”</p>\n\n<p>Structured Questions</p>\n\n<p>These questions have specific parts or steps students must address. For example: “Describe the structure of an atom. Include: a) definition of an atom, b) its main parts, c) how the parts are arranged.”</p>\n\n<p>Compare and Contrast</p>\n\n<p>These questions ask students to discuss similarities and differences between two or more things. For example: “Compare and contrast democracy and dictatorship as forms of government.”</p>\n\n<p>Cause and Effect</p>\n\n<p>Students must explain the reasons for something and its results. For example: “What were the causes of the Industrial Revolution, and how did it affect society?”</p>\n\n<p>Hypothetical Scenarios</p>\n\n<p>These questions present a made-up situation and ask students to respond. For example: “If you were the leader of your country, what would be your top three priorities and why?”</p>\n\n<p>Examples of Free Response Questions</p>\n\n<p>Here are some examples of free response questions from different subjects:</p>\n\n<p>English Literature</p>\n\n<p>“Analyze the theme of love in Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. Use specific examples from the text to support your answer.”</p>\n\n<p>History</p>\n\n<p>“Explain the main causes of the American Civil War. Discuss at least three factors and their relative importance.”</p>\n\n<p>Biology</p>\n\n<p>“Describe the process of photosynthesis.

Underline key words and make sure you understand what is being asked.</p>\n\n<p>2.\tPlan your answer before writing. Make a quick outline or list of main points.</p>\n\n<p>3.\tStart with a clear introduction that addresses the question directly.</p>\n\n<p>4.\tUse specific examples or evidence to support your points.</p>\n\n<p>5.\tOrganize your ideas logically. Use paragraphs to separate different points.</p>\n\n<p>6.\tWrite clearly and simply. Avoid unnecessary words or complicated language.</p>\n\n<p>7.\tIf time allows, review and edit your answer.</p>\n\n<p>8.\tMake sure you’ve answered all parts of the question.</p>\n\n<p>Tips for Writing Free Response Questions</p>\n\n<p>For teachers or test creators, here are tips for writing good free response questions:</p>\n\n<p>1.\tBe clear and specific about what you’re asking.</p>\n\n<p>2.\tUse action words like “explain,” “analyze,” or “compare” to guide the response.</p>\n\n<p>3.\tMake sure the question tests important concepts or skills.</p>\n\n<p>4.\tConsider how long the answer should be and how much time students will have.</p>\n\n<p>5.\tCreate a detailed grading rubric before giving the test.</p>\n\n<p>6.\tAvoid questions that can be answered with just facts or memorization.</p>\n\n<p>7.\tTest questions on a small group first to check for clarity and difficulty level.</p>\n\n<p>Grading Free Response Questions</p>\n\n<p>Grading free response questions can be challenging. Here are some common methods:</p>\n\n<p>Rubrics</p>\n\n<p>A rubric is a scoring guide that lists the criteria for a good answer. It helps make grading more fair and consistent. For example, a simple rubric might look like this:</p>\n\n<p>•\t3 points: Fully answers the question with clear explanation and examples</p>\n\n<p>•\t2 points: Partially answers the question with some explanation</p>\n\n<p>•\t1 point: Attempts to answer but lacks clear explanation or examples</p>\n\n<p>•\t0 points: Does not answer the question or is completely off-topic</p>\n\n<p>Point System</p>\n\n<p>Some questions use a point system for different parts of the answer. For example, in a math problem, you might get:</p>\n\n<p>•\t1 point for correct setup of the equation</p>\n\n<p>•\t2 points for correct solution process</p>\n\n<p>•\t1 point for the correct final answer</p>\n\n<p>Holistic Grading</p>\n\n<p>This method looks at the overall quality of the answer rather than specific parts. It’s often used for essay questions. The grader might use a scale like A, B, C, D, F based on how well the answer meets the overall goals of the question.</p>\n\n<p>Free Response Questions in Different Subjects</p>\n\n<p>Free response questions are used in many subjects, but they can look different in each:</p>\n\n<p>English</p>\n\n<p>Often asks for analysis of literature or writing essays on given topics. Focus is on writing skills, critical thinking, and understanding of texts.</p>\n\n<p>History</p>\n\n<p>May include document analysis, explaining historical events, or comparing different time periods. Tests understanding of historical concepts and ability to use evidence.</p>\n\n<p>Science</p>\n\n<p>Can involve explaining scientific processes, designing experiments, or analyzing data. Tests both knowledge of scientific facts and ability to apply scientific thinking.</p>\n\n<p>Math</p>\n\n<p>Usually involves solving problems and explaining the steps. Tests not just getting the right answer, but understanding the process.</p>\n\n<p>Social Sciences</p>\n\n<p>Might ask students to analyze social issues, explain theories, or apply concepts to real-world situations. Tests critical thinking and understanding of social dynamics.</p>\n\n<p>Free Response Questions in Standardized Tests</p>\n\n<p>Many important tests use free response questions. Here are some examples:</p>\n\n<p>AP Exams</p>\n\n<p>Advanced Placement tests often have a section of free response questions. These can be essays, problem-solving questions, or document analysis depending on the subject.</p>\n\n<p>SAT</p>\n\n<p>The SAT includes an optional essay section where students must analyze a given text and write an essay about it.</p>\n\n<p>GRE</p>\n\n<p>The Graduate Record Examination includes two essay tasks: analyzing an issue and analyzing an argument.</p>\n\n<p>IELTS and TOEFL</p>\n\n<p>These English language tests include writing tasks where test-takers must write essays on given topics.</p>\n\n<p>Using Free Response Questions in the Classroom</p>\n\n<p>Teachers can use free response questions in many ways:</p>\n\n<p>•\tAs homework assignments to check understanding of a topic</p>\n\n<p>•\tIn class discussions to encourage critical thinking</p>\n\n<p>•\tFor group work where students collaborate on answers</p>\n\n<p>•\tAs practice for standardized tests</p>\n\n<p>•\tFor project-based learning where students explore a topic in depth</p>\n\n<p>There are many online tools that can help with free response questions:</p>\n\n<p>•\tGoogle Forms: Teachers can create free response questions and collect answers easily</p>\n\n<p>•\tQuizlet: Offers flashcards and practice tests with free response options</p>\n\n<p>•\tKahoot: Can include open-ended questions in its interactive quizzes</p>\n\n<p>•\tTurnitin: Helps check for plagiarism in written responses</p>\n\n<p>•\tGrammarly: Can help students improve their writing for free response answers</p>\n\n<p>How to Practice Free Response Questions</p>\n\n<p>To get better at answering free response questions, try these tips:</p>\n\n<p>1.\tFind practice questions online or in study guides</p>\n\n<p>2.\tTime yourself when answering to build speed</p>\n\n<p>3.\tAsk a teacher or tutor to review your practice answers</p>\n\n<p>4.\tStudy example answers to see what good responses look like</p>\n\n<p>5.\tPractice outlining answers quickly before writing</p>\n\n<p>6.\tReview feedback on past tests or assignments</p>\n\n<p>Common Mistakes to Avoid</p>\n\n<p>Watch out for these common errors in free response questions:</p>\n\n<p>•\tNot answering all parts of the question</p>\n\n<p>•\tWriting too much irrelevant information</p>\n\n<p>•\tNot providing specific examples or evidence</p>\n\n<p>•\tPoor organization or unclear writing</p>\n\n<p>•\tMisunderstanding what the question is asking</p>\n\n<p>•\tRunning out of time before finishing the answer</p>\n\n<p>The Future of Free Response Questions</p>\n\n<p>Free response questions are likely to remain important in education, but they may change:</p>\n\n<p>•\tMore use of technology for answering and grading</p>\n\n<p>•\tIncreased focus on real-world problem-solving skills</p>\n\n<p>•\tCombination with other question types for more comprehensive assessment</p>\n\n<p>•\tGreater emphasis on creativity and original thinking</p>\n\n<p>•\tAdaptation for online and remote learning environments</p>\n\n<p>Conclusion</p>\n\n<p>Free response questions are a valuable tool in education and assessment. They test deep understanding, critical thinking, and communication skills. While they can be challenging, they help prepare students for real-world tasks that require analysis and explanation. With practice and the right strategies, students can improve their ability to answer these questions effectively. As education evolves, free response questions will likely continue to play an important role in helping students develop and demonstrate their knowledge and skills.</p>"

However, eating too much pizza can have some surprising side effects.</h2>\n\n<p>Pizza is usually high in calories, fat, and sodium, which can make it unhealthy if consumed excessively.</p>\n\n<p>© 2024 trstdly.com</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/N6iR0nt7QgRZqCa1vq1pN8w85Zx2QBQ0Y00rabNq.jpg\" alt=\"5 Surprising Side Effects of Eating Too Much Pizza\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Pizza is tasty, but eating too much of it can bring several side effects that can be harmful for your health. (Image by Freepik)</figcaption>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p>Here are some of the surprising side effects of eating too much pizza you should be aware of.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Weight Gain</h2>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p>Eating too much pizza can lead to weight gain. Pizzas are often high in calories and fat. When you eat more calories than your body uses, you gain weight. Over time, this can lead to obesity and other health problems.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/IMBYJCSPK2KJBuewFgRRwohhecJloUManGmwEQ50.jpg\" alt=\"1. Weight Gain\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Pizza is often high in calories and fat. Eating too much of it can lead to weight gain. (Image by rawpixel.com on Freepik)</figcaption>\n\n<h2>2. Lack of Fiber</h2>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p>Most pizzas do not contain much fiber. Fiber is important for your digestion and helps you feel full. When you eat pizza regularly, you may not get enough fiber. This can lead to unhealthy eating habits and cause you to feel hungry soon after.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/dDFGObC5Jv2CvtgEQqNV2MgBgTIzlgVPDoCFgMtt.jpg\" alt=\"2. Lack of Fiber\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Pizza often lacks fiber, so it can cause digestive problems. (Image by stockking on Freepik)</figcaption>\n\n<h2>3. High Risk of Constipation</h2>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p>Because pizza is low in fiber, eating a lot of it can lead to constipation. Constipation is when you have trouble going to the bathroom. This can make you feel uncomfortable and bloated. Eating more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help fix this problem.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/42FV5S8YsusmvKeEhyi85MDfCuzfVEjl2C8klrPr.jpg\" alt=\"3. High Risk of Constipation\"/>\n\n<figcaption>How to prevent diarrhea. (Image by jcomp on Freepik)</figcaption>\n\n<h2>4. Increase the Risk of Diabetes</h2>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p>Eating too much pizza can increase your risk of diabetes. Pizza is usually high in sugar and refined carbs, which can cause your blood sugar levels to rise. Over time, this can lead to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/aSrE6Ea5UuEmgLCdBWw8hb0y45kAIns4e6GnpwOm.jpg\" alt=\"4. Increase the Risk of Diabetes\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Garam masala can also contribute in controling blood sugar levels, and reduce the risk of diabetes. xb100</figcaption>\n\n<h2>5. Bad for Your Heart Health</h2>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p>Many types of pizza are high in saturated fats and sodium. Eating them often can increase your cholesterol levels and blood pressure. This can lead to heart disease and other serious health issues over time. Maintaining a balanced diet is important for heart health.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/aufute054VK1mA4ofnB7vsOP2YL18ja9OYfo6Nlu.jpg\" alt=\"5. Bad for Your Heart Health\"/>\n\n<figcaption>Sugar can increase blood pressure and bad cholesterol levels. © 2023 maverick</figcaption>\n\n<span></span>\n\n<p>While pizza can be a delicious treat, eating too much of it can have serious side effects. To enjoy pizza in a healthier way, consider making it at home using healthier ingredients like whole-grain crusts and plenty of vegetables. Limit your portion sizes and avoid overindulging. <br><br>By making these small changes, you can still enjoy pizza while minimizing its negative effects on your health. Remember, moderation is key.</p>"

Although he is considered a figure known to be wise and wise in dealing with life, it turns out that one thing disturbs his mind.<br><br>Scientists labeled the 78-year-old monk the world's happiest person after he was included in a 12-year study at the University of Wisconsin that examined meditation and compassion.<br><br>Upon receiving the label, the Frenchman, who lives in a monastery in Nepal, told GQ magazine that the label made no sense.</p>\n\n<p>\"I know monks who are happier. That's why I feel this [nickname] is very absurd,\" Ricard said, as reported by the Independent.<br><br>Struggling to cope with the attention he received after the study was published, Ricard also admitted that he had asked the Dalai Lama. He volunteered to join the contemplation.<br><br>But apparently, the Dalai Lama said that the world needs Ricard.<br><br>\"He [the Dalai Lama] said, if they want you to be the happiest person in the world, then be the happiest person,\" Ricard said.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnc-image.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/compressed/5gkR25j2Y4VmXJBe2LoRY0rqjOjiPXswjeQZZDmp.jpg\" alt=\"To reach the study's conclusion that Ricard is the happiest man in the world, brain ability expert Richard Davidson admitted to studying the brain sensors of 256 monks.\"/>\n\n<figcaption>To reach the study's conclusion that Ricard is the happiest man in the world, brain ability expert Richard Davidson admitted © 2024 trstdly.com</figcaption>\n\n<h2>To reach the study's conclusion that Ricard is the happiest man in the world, brain ability expert Richard Davidson admitted to studying the brain sensors of 256 monks.</h2>\n\n<p>Davidson then found that Ricard's brain produced gamma wave levels associated with awareness, attention, learning, and memory. This has never before been reported in any scientific literature.<br><br>\"The scans also showed excessive activity in the left prefrontal cortex, compared to the other side. That gives him a greater capacity to feel happy and reduces his tendency towards negative attitudes,\" says Davidson.<br></p>\n\n<p>Despite feeling awkward about labeling the study results, Ricard has shared his philosophy of life in a book. <br><br>His notes are titled Altruism, On the Path to Enlightenment, and Happiness.

They said, ‘Well, you haven’t changed now.’ At that point, it became a bit of a matter of principle for me.”</p>\n\n<p>According to Dexerto, Magnus Carlsen had been warned by the International Chess Federation the day before, but he still broke their rules the next day. Even so, many sources say that the jeans worn by Carlsen did not violate the rules.</p>\n\n<p>While GothamChess understands why Carlsen was banned from the tournament due to the dress code, it also argues that the dress code should not be the focus of the competition and that FIDE's action against the competitor was “unwarranted”.</p>"
